<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface">Preface</a></h2>


<p>In the following essay I use the term "bibliography of
bibliographies" only for works of universal scope. Accordingly
I discuss neither such national bibliographies as Giuseppe
Ottino and Giuseppe Fumagalli's <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica
italiana</i> (Rome, 1889) nor such special lists as
Gabriel Peignot's <i>Répertoire des bibliographies spéciales</i>
(Paris, 1808) and <i>A List of Bibliographies of Special Subjects</i>
(Chicago, 1902) issued by the John Crerar Library.
I exclude also lists of reference works.</p>

<p>Other groups of books have demanded less arbitrary
handling. In general, I have ruled out chapters on the bibliography
of bibliographies in handbooks of library science.
By the same token, I have included neither classified library
catalogues, public or private, nor catalogues of private
libraries owned by scholars or bibliographers in special
fields. Finally I discuss only those subject indexes that
were published before the bibliography of bibliographies
was recognized as an independent scholarly undertaking,
such as Conrad Gesner's <i>Pandectae</i> (1548) and Israel
Spach's <i>Nomenclator</i> (1598). All later subject indexes in
which the bibliography of bibliographies is subsidiary to
other purposes, have been excluded.</p>

<p>The bibliographies cited by short titles or the author's
names are listed in full in the Bibliography. I have given
locations for rare books only, and then only for the copies
that I have used. I have not tried to identify the works
cited in quotations illustrating bibliographical method or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to correct errors in such quoted titles, except when the book
is difficult to identify or when a correction is pertinent to
the discussion of the writer's bibliographical technique.</p>

<p>Various friends have generously read this essay in manuscript
and have offered suggestions for its improvement.
I am greatly indebted to them for this assistance. Dr. Arnold
Weinberger of Harvard University Library has given
me general advice and many comments on details. Taylor
Starck of Harvard University, Lawrence S. Thompson, Director
of the University of Kentucky Library, and Hugh G.
Dick of the University of California at Los Angeles have
given me good counsel. Anne E. Markley of the University
of California, School of Librarianship read the manuscript
with painstaking care and helped me to avoid many errors.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I">Chapter I</a><br />

<small>Beginnings of the
Bibliography of Bibliographies</small></h2>


<p>The introduction to St. Jerome's <i>De viris illustribus</i>
written in A.D. 392 may contain the first bibliography of
bibliographies. Here we find a list of nine men who had
written bibliographies of various kinds. St. Jerome writes
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You urge me, Dexter, to arrange ecclesiastical writers in imitation
of Suetonius<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and to do for men of our faith what he has
done in listing men famous in heathen letters. Among the
Greeks some have done the same thing: Hermippus Peripateticus,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Antigonus Carystius,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
the learned Satyrus,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Aristoxenus,
the musician,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who was by far the most learned, [and]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>furthermore, among the Romans,
Varro,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Santra,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Nepos, Hyginus,
and Suetonius, whom you cite as a model.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After a brief digression St. Jerome refers to Eusebius,
<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, which he has found very useful, and
then concludes with an allusion to Cicero, whom few would
now think of as a bibliographer. In this passage he makes
it clear that bibliography was not highly esteemed even in
A.D. 392:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And so I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ that, since your master
Cicero, who stood at the pinnacle of Roman eloquence, has not
disdained to compile a list of orators in the Latin language in his
<i>Brutus</i>, I may execute such a task worthily, pursuant to your request,
by listing the writers of His church.</p></blockquote>

<p>St. Jerome's list is an altogether acceptable bibliography
of bibliographies. It includes Antigonus Carystius and
Satyrus who wrote general biobibliographies, and Aristoxenus
who listed the pupils of Isocrates or the writers of
tragedy. We can infer that St. Jerome saw a common element
in the works of all these men. This common element
is the idea of a list or bibliography. Had he cited only
writers of general biobibliographies, we might imagine
that he thought of them as historians or chroniclers. In
the context of an introduction to his own bibliography of
Christian writers he must have thought of them as bibliographers.
He neglected to mention many other early
bibliographers with whom he was probably familiar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost thirteen centuries later Philip Labbé, whom we
shall learn to know as the first author of a bibliography of
bibliographies to be published as a separate work, found
St. Jerome's list and after making some additions, put it in
alphabetical order. He could not find a proper place for it
in his own bibliography of bibliographies, the <i>Bibliotheca
bibliothecarum</i> of 1664, and buried it without any apparent
reason immediately after a reference to a book by Constantinus
Felicius that dealt with Cicero's exile and glorious
return. I suspect that the slip containing this information
had been misplaced in his manuscript. Labbé wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Besides Damastes Sigiaeus,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> many have written on the lives of
scholars, for example, Agatharcides of Cnidus,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Amphicrates,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Antigonus Carystius, Aristoxenus, Artemon of Magnesia,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
the Carthaginian Charon,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Clearchus of Soli,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Hermippus
of Smyrna, Satyrus, Timagenes of Miletus,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and others,
and among Latin writers, Varro, Santra, Nepos, [and] Hyginus,
whom St. Jerome cites along with Suetonius on p. 62.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Labbé's careless treatment of this information suggests
that he had not finished preparing it for publication. The
text itself is not entirely intelligible. He did not put it, as
St. Jerome had done, in the introduction and failed to find
any other logical place for it. St. Jerome's list obviously
interested Labbé, for he quoted it again in the article
"Sanctus Hieronymus." When Antoine Teissier revised and
enlarged the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> in 1686, he came
upon this duplication and retained only the passage in the
article "Sanctus Hieronymus."</p>

<p>Except the long-forgotten Labbé, subsequent bibliographers
know nothing of St. Jerome's brief list. It did
not set anyone to writing bibliographies of bibliographies,
and no example has been reported in the almost uncharted
area of bibliographical history that lies between St. Jerome
and the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Modern bibliographies of bibliographies begin as sections
in general subject indexes. In any such index bibliography
is, as a matter of course, represented. Conrad Gesner's
<i>Pandectae</i>, 1548,<a name="FNanchor_16A_17" id="FNanchor_16A_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16A_17" class="fnanchor">[16a]</a> which is the first subject index to be
printed, begins with bibliography. The first book (<i>liber</i>)
of the <i>Pandectae</i> is entitled "De grammatica" and deals
with the classification and organization of knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Chapter (<i>titulus</i>) XIII, with which we are especially concerned,
is a treatise on general bibliography.<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Its eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>sections (<i>partes</i>) deal with books of general usefulness and
some related matters. Pars i, "Greek and Latin Writers of
Miscellanies and of Books Containing Critical Comments
on More than One Author," is well described by its title.
Gesner divides it into two parts: "Greek Miscellanies," including
such works as Aelian, <i>Varia historia</i>;<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Athenaeus,
<i>Deipnosophistae</i>;<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Clement of Alexandria, <i>Stromata</i>;<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and
Johannes Tzetzes, <i>Historia varia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Books of this sort were
reference works consulted for information on almost any
subject. To this alphabetical list Gesner adds three titles:
the accounts of marvels found in various works by Aristotle;
Julius Pollux, <i>Onomasticon</i>; and Plutarch, <i>Symposium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
For a bibliography of books of table talk similar to Plutarch's
work Gesner refers the reader to <i>Liber Politica,
Titulus Convivia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He adds a concluding remark that
Caelius Rhodiginus and Nicolaus Leonicenus&mdash;men who
had written widely used contemporary miscellanies&mdash;as
well as other makers of compilations have drawn freely on
the authorities that he has listed. Gesner is a good bibliographer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>He has arranged these titles carefully and has
clearly indicated how much he knows about them and the
translations of them.</p>

<p>The second part of Titulus XIII, Pars i, is devoted to Latin
miscellanies. It begins with Alexander ab Alexandro
(Alessandro Alessandri, d. 1523), <i>Geniales dies</i>, "which
contains grammatical and legal collectanea and comments
on various authors." Gesner remarks that he has preferred
to cite miscellanies and collections of <i>loci communes</i> because
a separately printed treatise can be easily found but
the information in a miscellany is likely to be overlooked.<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
He then names some fifteen Latin miscellanies of various
dates according to the first names of the authors. Among
them are the writings of Angelo Poliziano, Aulus Gellius,
the <i>Adagia</i> of Erasmus, the <i>Varia</i> of Cassiodorus, the <i>Saturnalia</i>
of Macrobius, the <i>De honesta disciplina</i> by Petrus
Crinitus, and the <i>De inventoribus rerum</i> by Polydore Vergil.
This mingling of classical and contemporary authorities is
characteristic of Renaissance scholarship. Gesner concludes
with a citation of a quarto <i>Miscellanea</i> printed in Paris by
Gormont and written by an unidentified author (<i>nescio quo
authore</i>).<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Gesner's free use of cross-references shows how carefully
he planned his book. For example, he reminds the reader
that miscellanies dealing with such natural objects as
metals, stones, animals, and plants will be found in the book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>entitled <i>Physica</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> those concerned with the words and
deeds of famous men will be found in Caelius Rhodiginus,<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and epistolographers, who may be thought of as authors of
books of a miscellaneous character, will be found in a later
section.<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In a subdivision indicated by a paragraph sign
but without a centerhead Gesner says that dictionaries contain
miscellaneous information, cites examples, and adds a
cross-reference to his discussion of dictionaries. As is evident,
he has covered the sources of miscellaneous information
rather fully.</p>

<p>In a second division of this part Gesner names writers
who have written comments on several authors and have
printed them in a single volume. He cites eleven examples,
beginning with Bassianus Landus (Bassiano Landi, d.
1562), <i>Epiphyllides</i><a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and including the manuscript notes
of his contemporary, the Neapolitan grammarian, L. J. Scoppa.
Since the <i>Epiphyllides</i> does not seem to have been
printed and a contemporary scholar's manuscript notes are
obviously difficult to find, Gesner can be said to have taken
great pains with the list. He excludes those who have
written one or more volumes of commentary on a single
author.</p>

<p>In Pars ii, <i>De indicibus librorum</i>, an extremely interesting
discussion of indexes with rather little bibliographical
baggage, Gesner differentiates and discusses several varieties
and brings his discussion of methods to a close with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>some remarks about page numbers and chapter numbers.<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
A paragraph sign sets off a list of indexes to various books,
chiefly editions of the classics and Biblical or patristic writings.
This list would have been very useful to H. B. Wheatley
in writing <i>What is an Index?</i> (London, 1879). On the
next page (fols. 21<sup>a</sup>-21<sup>b</sup>) Gesner names a few publishers'
catalogues and, after a paragraph sign, a few library catalogues.<a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Pars ii ends with a long discussion of the ways of
cataloguing books (fols. 21<sup>b</sup>-22<sup>b</sup>).</p>

<p>Pars iii, <i>Problemata, Quaestiones &amp; Disputationes</i>, is
a strictly bibliographical account of special varieties of miscellanies.<a name="FNanchor_33_34" id="FNanchor_33_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
The next two Partes contain a discussion of the
methodology of note-taking and are not directly bibliographical
in nature. Pars vi lists some forty collections of
commonplaces (fols. 27<sup>b</sup>-28<sup>a</sup>). Among them are Antonius
Corvinus's arrangement of Erasmus's <i>Apophthegmata</i> in
commonplaces,<a name="FNanchor_34_35" id="FNanchor_34_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Stobaeus, Thomas Hibernicus,<a name="FNanchor_35_36" id="FNanchor_35_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Maximus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Planudes (who expurgated and arranged the Greek Anthology
in <i>loci communes</i>), Otto Brunfels (whose <i>Pandectae
sacrae</i><a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Gesner has used freely), and Valerius Maximus.
Such books were more or less like general reference works.
Here, as elsewhere, Gesner names classical and contemporary
writers in a single list.</p>

<p>We have been examining thus far Gesner's account of
general reference works and come finally to the seventh
pars, which is the most interesting division of the titulus
for a student of bibliographical history. It is entitled <i>Bibliographies,
i.e. alphabetical list of catalogues of books, the
classification of books, the care of them, mottoes, and the
buildings</i>.<a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This title is virtually the table of contents of a
handbook of library science.<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> We shall consider only the
first sections of this pars and in particular Gesner's bibliography
of bibliographies.</p>

<p>Gesner begins the seventh pars with miscellaneous
notes on pertinent books and on libraries. He carefully
separates these notes from the following bibliography of
bibliographies. This is an alphabetical list of thirty-one
names, beginning with</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

Apollodorus Athenien. Bibliothecae pars etiamnun extat.</p>

<p>In this list Gesner includes both general and special
bibliographies. He cites St. Jerome's <i>De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis</i>
(a variant title of the <i>De viris illustribus</i>) and
the continuations by Bede, Gennadius of Marseilles, Honorius
Augustodunensis, Isidore of Seville, and Sigebert of
Gembloux; Johannes Tritheim, who compiled the original
work of St. Jerome and the continuations into a single volume;
and Sophronius, who translated it into Greek. He
cites contemporary legal bibliographies, one by Bernardinus
Rutilius (Bernardino Rutilio, 1504-1538), who dealt with
men of his own time, and another by Johannes Fichardus
(Johann Fichard, 1512-1581), the often published <i>Juris consultorum
vitae veterum quidem</i>, which surveyed older authorities.<a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
He has seen or heard of Jacob Rueff's survey of
astrologers, Lilio Gregorio Giraldi's literary history, Otto
Brunfels's bibliography of medicine in classical times, and
Philip Ribot's biobibliographical dictionary of the Carmelite
order. The last he has not seen but believes to have
been utilized by Johannes Tritheim.</p>

<p>These names illustrate the variety of bibliographies
known to Gesner and his clear conception of what a bibliography
of bibliographies should be. He has admitted only
pertinent books and has arranged their titles carefully in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>alphabetical order according to first names. He has given
sources for citations that he has not verified and for books
that he knows to be in manuscript or probably lost. He
has commented occasionally on the quality of a book or has
told how it was arranged. For example, he says that Rueff's
astrological bibliography contains pictures of men and instruments
and comments in German verse. He does not
give the dates and places of publication, but bibliographers
have been slow to learn the importance of citing these details.
No doubt he expected his readers to consult his biobibliographical
dictionary, the <i>Bibliotheca universalis</i> of
1545, for that information. A sixteenth-century scholar,
who was accustomed to find books arranged according to
format, might have complained that Gesner did not indicate
the size of the books. In his procedure he goes beyond St.
Jerome, who was content to cite only names. Gesner cites
titles.</p>

<p>In Pars viii, "De mirabilibus," the last subdivision of
Titulus XIII, Gesner gives a hasty account of books about
marvels and noteworthy things. Although he cites several
lost classical works on the subject and Alessandro Alessandri,
<i>Geniales dies</i>, which had appeared in print a generation
before the <i>Pandectae</i>, he makes no great effort to deal
bibliographically with the subject. He obviously regards
such works as collections of odds and ends and therefore
akin to miscellanies. He says, for example, that geographers
tell strange tales about the shapes and manners of men and
the nature of countries, skies, and seas. He could, he says,
have given here references to ancient statues and inscriptions,
but has preferred to classify them under history. Poetry
and invented tales might also be mentioned and riddles,
he thinks, are not to be neglected. The remaining tituli
of the first book deal with matters akin to grammar in its
usual modern sense but include several specialized bibliographies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that we need not examine closely.<a name="FNanchor_41_42" id="FNanchor_41_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Gesner's
bibliography of bibliographies represents an auspicious beginning
of a very difficult variety of bibliography.</p>

<p>The foregoing details about the first book in Gesner's
<i>Pandectae</i> make clear Gesner's skill in organization and
classification as well as the place that the bibliography of
bibliographies had in his scheme. They give some notion
of sixteenth-century scholarship and explain why Gesner's
<i>Pandectae</i> failed to be continued or revised and, more especially,
why his bibliography of bibliographies has not
been noticed. Even A. G. S. Josephson, who had a very
sharp eye for bibliographies of bibliographies concealed as
chapters in subject indexes, did not come upon Gesner's
work. Josephson's study will be mentioned in its proper
place at the end of this essay. Gesner's subject bibliography
was not appreciated fully because it contained many references
to classical sources and did not give a comprehensive
account of contemporary writings. Although Gesner's classification
was logical and although he adhered with remarkable
care to the categories that he set up, no one but
Gesner himself could make additions to the book or revise
it.</p>

<p>It remains to say a word about the relation of the <i>Pandectae</i>
to the book of which it forms a part. Gesner published
four volumes&mdash;the <i>Bibliotheca universalis</i> of 1545,
the <i>Pandectae</i> of 1548, the <i>Partitiones</i> of 1549, and the <i>Appendix</i>
of 1555&mdash;that are ordinarily regarded as a single
work. The <i>Bibliotheca</i> and the <i>Appendix</i> constitute a biobibliographical
dictionary. The <i>Pandectae</i> and the <i>Partitiones</i>
are a subject index that lacks a promised section on
medicine. The dictionary and the index have no close relations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>to each other, except to the degree that the dictionary
gives additional information about books cited by authors'
names in the index. In Gesner's situation a modern
scholar would have distributed according to subjects the
slips that he had made for his biobibliographical dictionary
and would thus have obtained a subject index almost immediately.
Gesner did not proceed in this way, but undertook
and completed the subject index as a virtually independent
work.</p>

<p>The next man to write a bibliography of bibliographies
gives no evidence of having read Gesner's work or, more
specifically, of having come upon Gesner's bibliography of
bibliographies. He is Israel Spach (1560-1610), who wrote
a general subject index at the end of the sixteenth century.
In the bibliographical section, "Writers of Bibliographies
(Bibliothecarum scriptores)," of his <i>Nomenclator philosophorum
et philologicorum</i>, (1598), Spach names twenty-nine
books. Of these only two medical and two legal bibliographies
were known to Gesner, and one of these legal
bibliographies is cited in a better edition that appeared long
after the publication of the <i>Pandectae</i>. Spach's emphasis
lies on contemporary works. Although he mentions the
medieval continuators of St. Jerome, he does not mention
St. Jerome himself. Inasmuch as these continuators were
brought together in Johannes Tritheim, <i>De viris illustribus</i>,
which he cites,<a name="FNanchor_42_43" id="FNanchor_42_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> he could have dispensed with them. He
begins with Antoine du Verdier's supplement (1585) to
Gesner's <i>Bibliotheca universalis</i> and then mentions Apollodorus,
whose <i>Bibliotheca</i> was still unpublished. Apollodorus
and Claudius Ptolemy, <i>Sententiae</i> (also unpublished)
are the only two bibliographers of classical times that he
names. Spach knows general works like Conrad Gesner's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><i>Bibliotheca</i>, Robert Constantin's compilation (1555) that
purported to be a supplement to it, and Nicolaus Basse's
cumulation (1592) of the semi-annual catalogues of the
German booktrade; national bibliographies like Anton
Francesco Doni's <i>La libraria</i> (1556)<a name="FNanchor_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and John Bale's list
of English authors; and, finally, bibliographies of special
disciplines like ecclesiastical history, medicine (Otto Brunfels
and Symphorien Champier), and law. In these categories
he has chosen appropriate books. Although he includes
Hierimias Paduanus, who wrote a very popular collection
of <i>loci communes</i> that circulated also under the
name of Thomas Hibernicus (Thomas Palmer),<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> he agrees
with Gesner in preferring to list such works separately.</p>

<p>In the fifty years between the publication of Gesner's
<i>Pandectae</i> and Spach's <i>Nomenclator</i> bibliographers had
come to recognize the value of several kinds of compilations
that Gesner had not chosen to include. For example, Spach
cites the catalogues issued by publishers,<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> a category that
Gesner knew but separated from his bibliography of bibliographies.
He includes some titles that most bibliographers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>would not now include in a bibliography of bibliographies,
for example, a book dealing with the book
trade,<a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
a book dealing with a particular library,<a name="FNanchor_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> a famous
catalogue of Greek manuscripts at Augsburg.<a name="FNanchor_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Titles such
as Wolfgang Lazius, <i>Catalogus partim suorum, partim aliorum
scriptorum</i><a name="FNanchor_49_50" id="FNanchor_49_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_50" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> do not indicate clearly the contents of
the book. Spach has thrown his net wide and has caught
some fish that we can not call bibliographies. Nevertheless,
all the works that he cites deal with books, and we shall
not quarrel with him for including treatises on the Frankfurt
book fair or the Vatican library. Two titles show how
widely he ranged in the search for materials. John Boston's
fourteenth-century union catalogue of manuscripts owned
in England has come to his knowledge,<a name="FNanchor_50_51" id="FNanchor_50_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_51" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and he has
picked up Claudius Ptolemy, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<i>Sententiae sive de utilitate
librorum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_52" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
which was, in one form or another, a popular
book about books during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. Spach's omission of regional or national bibliographies
and biobibliographical dictionaries, except for
Bale and Doni, and of biobibliographical dictionaries of the
religious orders is obvious. Perhaps he regarded them as
historical rather than bibliographical reference works.</p>

<p>As we have seen, Spach offers a good account of sixteenth-century
bibliographies and especially of those published
in the latter half of the century. When taken in conjunction
with Gesner's earlier bibliography, which reviewed
classical writers and his own contemporaries, Spach's list
provides us with a good account of sixteenth-century bibliography.</p>

<p>The bibliographical section, "Writers of Bibliographies
(Bibliothecarum Scriptores)," in a general subject index entitled
<i>Bibliotheca philosophica</i> (1616) by Paulus Bolduanus
continues the tradition represented by Gesner and Spach.
I have not been able to learn much about the life and works
of this obscure Pomeranian minister of the gospel, who apparently
lived and died in or near the village of Stolp.<a name="FNanchor_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> He
wrote bibliographies of theology, history, and philosophy
between 1614 and 1622, publishing in the latter year a supplement
to his theological bibliography. Petzholdt rightly
commends (pp. 458-459) the <i>Bibliotheca philosophica</i> as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>superior to Spach's <i>Nomenclator</i> but curiously fails to see
that Bolduan's notion of philosophy was in general use in
the first half of the seventeenth century. A <i>bibliotheca
philosophica</i> of that time would include as a matter of
course everything but theology, law, and medicine. Petzholdt
praises (pp. 771-772) Bolduan's <i>Bibliotheca historica</i>
(1620) as a respectable work that shows bibliographical
skill and accuracy. These are kinder words than Petzholdt
can ordinarily find for a seventeenth-century bibliography
and are a corrective to Burkhard Gotthelf Struve's harsh
judgment: "In our day, when other works of this sort are
available, we can easily dispense with these efforts."<a name="FNanchor_53_54" id="FNanchor_53_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_54" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Bolduan's bibliography of bibliographies<a name="FNanchor_54_55" id="FNanchor_54_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_55" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> is both longer
and more carefully made than Spach's. He has arranged
nearly seventy titles alphabetically according to the first
names of the authors. He cites catalogues of university
libraries (only the Leyden catalogue of 1595 could have
been within Spach's reach and he did not know it), the
compilations made for the book trade by Nicolaus Basse,
Johannes Clessius, and Henning Grosse, the ubiquitous
publisher's lists issued by Goltzius and Oporinus, and bibliographical
dictionaries of various subjects and the religious
orders. Like Spach, whose list he seems to have taken
over completely, he has heard of John Boston's catalogue
and, like Spach, is ignorant of the author's first
name and is compelled to cite it under "Bostonus." He corrects
Spach's misspelling of Muzio Pansa's name. He does
not, however, include any classical Greek or Latin bibliographers.
We can therefore infer that he did not find Gesner's
bibliography of bibliographies, where they were mentioned.
He might have omitted them on principle, but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>also fails to mention some early sixteenth-century bibliographies
known to Gesner which he would surely have included,
had he known them. An example of such a bibliography
is Jacob Rueff's book on astrology. Bolduan names
no title that cannot be called a bibliography in some sense.
In both extent and accuracy he surpasses Spach. As comparison
with Theodore Besterman, <i>The Beginnings of
Systematic Bibliography</i>,<a name="FNanchor_55_56" id="FNanchor_55_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_56" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> shows, this competent workman
gives a good account of the bibliographies available
in 1616.</p>

<p>A dozen years later, in 1628, Franciscus Sweertius
(Francis Sweerts, 1567-1629) printed a bibliography of bibliographies
about as large as that by Bolduan. He does
not cite his predecessors and probably did not know them.
This learned Antwerp merchant and author of several
scholarly works printed his bibliography of bibliographies
in his <i>Athenae Belgicae</i>.<a name="FNanchor_56_57" id="FNanchor_56_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It has no organic relation to
Sweerts's purpose of writing a Belgian biobibliographical
dictionary. In this compilation, which has a slightly stronger
theological tinge than its predecessors, Sweerts lists seventy-eight
bibliographies in twenty paragraphs according
to subjects. This is, therefore, the first classified bibliography
of bibliographies. Except in five instances with such
headings as "De Bibliothecis" and "De Vitis &amp; Scriptoribus
Ord. S. Dominici," the subjects are to be inferred from the
typographical arrangement. Although he has not completely
worked out a scheme of organization, he progresses
from general works on libraries and books to special bibliographies
of theology, law, and medicine. He is less careful
than Spach and Bolduan about the bibliographical details
of place and date of publication, but the need for this
information was just beginning to be recognized at the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>when he wrote. He adheres closely to the idea of listing
bibliographies and admits only one perhaps pardonable interloper,
a compilation of the Church Fathers. It is curious
that he cites the <i>Bibliotheca theologica</i> by Johannes Molanus
(Jean van der Meulen), which was published in 1618,
as being still in manuscript. Later bibliographers have
picked up all the titles cited by Sweerts and his selection
does not differ sufficiently from that made by Spach and
Bolduan to need characterization by quoting titles. Sweerts
wrote the first independent or almost independent bibliography
of bibliographies and at the same time the first classified
bibliography of bibliographies.</p>

<p>The four bibliographies of bibliographies published in
the eighty years between Gesner's <i>Pandectae</i> (1548) and
Sweert's <i>Athenae Belgicae</i> (1628) are, as their authors intended
them to be, relatively complete. In <i>The Beginnings
of Systematic Bibliography</i>, Theodore Besterman adds only
a few rather unimportant titles and these may indeed not
have seemed to be bibliographies or to have deserved mention
in the eyes of Gesner and his successors. Instructive
technical developments are evident in these first four compilations.
Gesner cites both classical Greek and Latin
works and contemporary bibliographies. Spach, Bolduan,
and Sweerts adopt the modern practice of preferring to list
bibliographies of contemporary usefulness. Gesner, Spach,
and Bolduan do not separate their work from the larger
task of writing a general subject index. Sweerts sees that
the bibliography of bibliographies can be an independent
enterprise. Gesner, Spach, and Bolduan offer alphabetical
lists. Sweerts adopts the modern plan of a classified list.
Although the bibliography of bibliographies has continued
to be a necessary part of a general subject index, I shall limit
myself in the following discussion to bibliographies of bibliographies
that have been published as separate works.</p>

<small>The Bibliography of Bibliographies
Comes of Age</small></h2>


<p>In the seventeenth century several bibliographies of
bibliographies were undertaken as independent enterprises.
One of them was actually completed and published and after
several editions had the good fortune to be revised and
to receive a supplement. A century after Gesner had published
his bibliographies of authors and subjects, in the decade
between 1643 and 1653, Jodocus a Dudinck, who did
not fulfill his promise, and Philip Labbé, sought to survey all
scholarship and hit upon the idea of a bibliography of
bibliographies as a means to this end. Like Conrad Gesner's
<i>Bibliotheca universalis</i> of 1545-1555 (which was a
list of all writers and their works), Philip Labbé's <i>Bibliotheca
bibliothecarum</i> of 1653 (which was a bibliography
of bibliographies) enjoyed a successful career for a little
more than a generation and then disappeared from view.
After the first revisions and supplements no one chose to
continue either Gesner or Labbé. This analogy between
the century that began with the invention of printing and
ended with Gesner's survey of 1545-1555 and the following
century that ended with Labbé's survey of 1653 is perhaps
more curious than important. It does nevertheless emphasize
a twice-repeated interruption in the historical development
of bibliographies. In the two generations between
1643 and 1705 men in various countries compiled or
promised to compile bibliographies of bibliographies and
with the beginning of the eighteenth century they ceased
to do so.</p>

<p>The first separately published bibliography of bibliographies
is, if it actually exists, Jodocus a Dudinck, <i>Bibliothecariographia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
(Cologne, apud Jodocum Kalcoven, 1643.)
No one has ever seen it and many have searched for
it during the last three centuries. Back in the seventeenth
century the Lutheran theologian Caspar Sagittarius (1643-1694)
sought it in vain. A little later Johann Andreas
Schmidt or Schmid (1652-1726), who was both a theologian
and a writer on library science, was similarly defeated in
an effort to find the book. Probably Hieronymus Augustinus
Groschufius was right when he said in one of the
earliest treatises on rare books (1709-1716) that the <i>Bibliothecariographia</i>
was never printed.<a name="FNanchor_57_58" id="FNanchor_57_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The first reference
to the book is found, as far as I know, in a Belgian biobibliographical
dictionary of 1643 and all our information
about the book and its author goes back to this source.<a name="FNanchor_58_59" id="FNanchor_58_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The announcement is not particularly suspicious because
the publisher Jodocus Kalcoven of Cologne seems to have
been an agent or a limited partner of the famous firm of
Willem Blaeu (later Jan Blaeu) of Amsterdam.<a name="FNanchor_59_60" id="FNanchor_59_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_60" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> This firm
used Kalcoven's name on various scholarly books.<a href="#Footnote_59_60" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Little
as we know about Dudinck's book, its title indicates that
he clearly understood the nature of a bibliography of
bibliographies. He called it "A Bibliography of Bibliographies.
A list of all authors and works that have appeared
under the title of bibliography, catalogue, index, list, athenae,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and so on."<a name="FNanchor_60_61" id="FNanchor_60_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Jodocus a Dudinck had a very good eye
for opportunities in the bibliographical field. He announced
a general treatise on libraries<a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and both a bibliography of
the Virgin Mary and an account of the places associated
with her.<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> No one has even seen any of Dudinck's books,
but the fact that books on all these subjects were written
by other hands within a generation shows his ingenuity
and judgment as a bibliographer. Nothing appears to be
known about Dudinck beyond what Valerius Andreas has
to say. He was a priest in a small village in the Rhineland,
"multae vir lectionis."</p>

<p>Ten years after the announcement of Dudinck's book
Philip Labbé (1607-1667) printed a bibliography of bibliographies
as a supplement to his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<i>Novae bibliothecae
specimen</i> (1653).<a name="FNanchor_63_64" id="FNanchor_63_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_64" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
He seems to have regarded this later
as a separate publication and has caused some confusion
by doing so. On its separate title page the date of this
supplement is 1652, but the supplement does not appear
to have been issued separately and the title page of the
book bears the date 1653. This bibliography of bibliographies
is entitled: "Supplementum novae bibliothecae,
sive speciminis antiquarum lectionum, coronis libraria. Hoc
est, Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum, &amp; Catalogus Catalogorum,
Nomenclatorum, Indicum, Elenchorum, &amp;c. quibus Scriptores
in quavis arte &amp; professione praecipui, &amp;c. libri ferme
omnes, partim editi, partim inediti repraesentantur." Here
Labbé has defined the proper contents of a bibliography of
bibliographies. He has included very few inappropriate
titles in his list of nearly three hundred separately published
bibliographies, bibliographies that were still in manuscript,
and bibliographies published in non-bibliographical
works. There are very few examples of the last category.
He is careful about his work. For example, he cites a
manuscript biobibliographical dictionary by Alfonsus Ciaconius
(Alfonso Chacón, 1540-1599) and gives his authority
in Antonio Possevino, <i>Apparatus sacer</i> (Cologne, 1608).
Chacón's dictionary was not printed until 1731, and then
only as a fragment. Labbé knows Alfonso Barvoet's catalogue
of manuscripts in the Escorial; Alfonso García's list
of famous Spaniards; Ambrosio Gozzi's biobibliographical
dictionary of Dominicans; Andreas Quercetanus's (André
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Duchesne, 1584-1640) bibliography of French history
(three editions are cited); autobibliographies like "Index
librorum F. Angeli Rochensis. Romae 1611"; national bibliographies
like that for France by Antoine du Verdier;
and a classical miscellany like Athenaeus, <i>Deipnosophistae</i>,
which scholars then regarded as a bibliography. In
other words, Labbé has named examples of varieties of
bibliographies that we now recognize. Although he mentions
a publisher's catalogue (which he has not seen), he
seems doubtful about its pertinence to the task. He comments,
for example, on a collective volume in the De Thou
library that contained catalogues issued by Plantin, Froschauer,
Wechel, and other publishers and says that he is
not including it. Labbé's comments are abundant and
informative. This first independent bibliography of bibliographies
is a commendable piece of work.</p>

<p>Labbé realized that he had hit upon a new and important
idea and worked diligently to improve and enlarge
his collections. In 1662 he published a sample of his plans
for several bibliographies under the title of <i>Sexdecim
librorum initia</i>. This consisted of the first eight pages
of each of ten bibliographies on which he was working
and discussions of six more that he expected to write. The
first eight pages of the bibliography of bibliographies extend
to Antonius Possevinus (inclusive). A comparison of
the complete list of 1653, the sample of 1662, and the
book that was finally printed in 1664 is necessarily limited
to a portion of the alphabet. In 1653 he cited fourteen
names (some of these authors were responsible for several
bibliographies), in 1662 he cited thirty-three names, and
in 1664 he cited sixty-eight names (including the additions
made in a supplementary alphabet). In 1653 he regretted
his inability to find a publisher's catalogue issued by Aldus
Manutius. In 1662 he reported that he had not found it.
In 1664 he cited publishers' catalogues issued by both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Aldus Manutius and Aldus Manutius, Junior. In both 1662
and 1664 he made additions to the titles listed under various
names, introduced new cross-references, and made improvements
in details. As an example of an improvement,
note his correction of the name Antonius Bumaldus to
Joannes Antonius Bumaldus. This apparently minor change
is important because Labbé's arrangement of authors according
to their Christian names required him to transfer
the name from the letter "A" to the letter "J."</p>

<p>Although Labbé greatly improved his book between
1653 and 1664, he nevertheless published it without incorporating
all the additions into the main alphabet and
without making full and accurate indexes. Subsequent
editions did not completely remedy these serious defects.
In 1672, when Labbé had been dead for five years, an
anonymous editor combined the additions with the main
alphabet, but did not correct errors in the text or improve
the indexes. In 1678, the unsold sheets of the 1672 edition
were issued with a new title page and a brief appendix
containing John Selden's numismatic bibliography. The
last edition of the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> was printed
at Leipzig in 1682. It is called "enlarged (auctior)," but
in a rather extensive comparison I have found only one
new title. The German editor removed some of Labbé's
comments on Protestant writers but did little more.</p>

<p>Labbé's <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> is an alphabetical
list according to first names of some eight hundred
authors of bibliographies. According to Besterman, it includes
about fifteen hundred titles. Labbé's arrangement
according to first names causes no difficulty to a modern
user because he provides an index of family names. Unfortunately,
however, this index of family names is incomplete,
and the lack of care in its preparation is evidence
that Labbé hurried to get his book to the printer.</p>

<p>Eight subject indexes&mdash;only the fourth is not alphabetical&mdash;make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> fully usable.
When the reader has familiarized himself with them (and
apparently very few have done so), he can understand
the book and its value to a scholar. In working with
the indexes he will discover that Labbé did not make
them complete and reliable. Part of the difficulty in
understanding and using the indexes arises from Labbé's
old and unfamiliar classification according to men instead
of subjects. This classification was firmly established when
Labbé wrote and he probably never thought of any other.
St. Jerome had called his book by the alternative title
"De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis," that is to say, "Ecclesiastical
Writers," but it was a bibliography of ecclesiastical
literature. A bibliography of astrology was, in Labbé's conception,
a list of men who wrote on astrology. He soon
ran into difficulties and adopted devices to get around
them that show bibliographical method in a transitional
state. In "Index I. Practitioners of Various Arts and Sciences
(Index Primus. Professores variarum scientiarum
atque artium representans)" we find such entries as "Advocatorum
Consistorialium, Advocatorum Parisiensis Curiae,
Aristotelis Graecorum Interpretum, Arithmeticorum,"
which we can translate (changing to the nominative case)
as "Consistorial Lawyers, Lawyers of the Parisian Court,
Greek Interpreters of Aristotle, Arithmeticians." These
designations are to be understood as references to as many
subjects. "Index II. [Bibliographies of] Nations and
Countries" and "Index III. [Bibliographies of] Religions
and Religious Orders," which does not include non-Christian
religions or heretical sects, give him no trouble. In
the fourth index Labbé meets his Waterloo. This "Index
IV. Authors Writing on Various Subjects" is awkwardly
conceived in terms of the authors but is arranged according
to the theological merit of the subjects on which they
wrote. It descends from the Virgin Mary to inventions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in the following order: (1) writers about the Virgin Mary,
(2) [writers about] the Immaculate Conception, (3)
writers who were popes, (4) writers who were cardinals,
(5) writers who were French cardinals, (6) women writers,
(7) writers about heretics, (8) writers on the prohibition
of heretical books, (9) compilers of catalogues of manuscripts,
(10) compilers of catalogues of ancient and modern
libraries and writers on library science, (11) writers on
academies, universities, and Jesuit colleges, (12) writers
of catalogues and eulogies of individual academies and
their faculties, (13) writers on the inventors of things, arts,
and sciences. In order to fit his material into this pattern
Labbé changes his procedure and writes in an individual
entry in No. 10 above: "Manuscriptorum catalogus varias
exhibent Antonius Sanderus, Aubertus Miraeus,..." In
other words, the subject heading takes the place of a
heading in terms of the author. The fifth index lists
bibliographers of men who have borne the same name.
Anton Sander's book on Antonies is an example. Such
works were very popular in Labbé's day and deserved this
special attention. The sixth index is a list of bibliographies,
which are often autobibliographies, of individual writers
and of indexes to their works. The seventh index includes
publishers' and booksellers' catalogues. In the somewhat
confused eighth index, which again illustrates the difficulty
already discussed, Labbé intended to list bibliographies
having a proper name in their titles. Here are
found books on the Ambrosian and Amsterdam libraries,
Labbé's own anti-Jansenist bibliography, and an anonymous
catalogue of anti-Jesuitica. He preferred to put the
last two bibliographies here and not in the third index,
which contained religious bibliographies. He had already
set up a category for writers about the Virgin Mary in
the fourth index, but he named others in the eighth. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
cannot see why he placed writers of dictionaries in the
eighth and not in the fourth index, and certainly he should
have put writers on chemistry and politics in the first and
not the eighth index. These irregularities are difficult to
explain. In a search for a subject bibliography a modern
reader must turn to the first, fourth, and eighth indexes.
He will find a national or local biobibliography in Index
II, a biobibliography of a religious order in Index III, a
list of works on homonyms in Index V, a bibliography of
an individual author in Index VI, and a catalogue issued
by a publisher or bookseller in Index VII. The classification
is complicated but not altogether unusable.</p>

<p>In the eleven years that passed between the first
publication of the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> and its
final appearance in 1664, Labbé might have worked out
the details more carefully than he did. We can of course
pardon some faults because modern bibliographers are
more demanding than those of 1664. We may, however,
say fine words about these demands and be forced to eat
our words when we look later in this essay at the modern
bibliographies of Léon Vallée, Henri Stein and the very
recent work of Hanns Bohatta and Franz Hodes. While
we are mindful of the old saying about those who live in
glass houses, we can nevertheless point out inconsistencies,
irregularities in procedure, awkward arrangements of materials,
and outright errors. The faults to be found in
Labbé's book are relatively slight and do not seriously
impair its value.</p>

<p>Labbé is inconsistent and irregular in method. He
seems to have learned to cite titles in the original languages
when he was nearly through collecting them. It
was too late to change and furthermore his sources probably
often gave him Latin and not the original French
or Italian titles. For example, he cites a book by Augustinus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Superbus by its Latin title and adds the note "Italicè."<a name="FNanchor_64_65" id="FNanchor_64_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_65" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
In the seventeenth century this was an altogether regular
way of citing an Italian title. He also cites the same book
with an Italian title. In reading the proof he could have
removed the duplication. The article on Augustinus Marloratus
seems to have been written before he realized the
necessity of bringing the author's name into the first place
for the purpose of alphabetizing the entries. He is irregular
in regard to critical comment, which the plan of his
book did not require. He usually adds none, but see, as
exceptions, the remarks on Angelus Roccha, Conradus Gesnerus,
Conradus Lycosthenes, and Joannes Neander. It
will be noticed at once that all but one of these men are
Protestants. In a few instances Labbé gives additional information
about the subject of the book that he is citing.
For example, he adds a paragraph to the citation of a
catalogue of heretical writers compiled by Bernardus
Luxemburgensis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Regarding these men [i.e., heretical authors] ancient writers
ought also to be consulted: Philastrius, Augustine, the author
of <i>Praedestinati</i> (edited by Sirmondus), St. Epiphanius, St. John
Damascene, and others.</p></blockquote>

<p>This paragraph may indicate that Labbé considered
including subjects but did not find a way to do so. Critics
of the <i>Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum</i> and among them
Adrien Baillet, who should have known better, have called
for interpretative and critical comments. They ought to
have perceived that such comments, although useful,
would have greatly exceeded Labbé's purpose. In all the
later history of bibliographies of bibliographies only two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>men&mdash;Gabriel Peignot and Julius Petzholdt&mdash;have made
a systematic effort to add comments. Labbé does, to be
sure, often express his opinion about heretical books, and
his warnings have awakened Protestant wrath and have
caused Protestant bibliographers to speak harshly of him.
He has rarely expressed himself so vigorously as he does
in the article "Robertus Cocus" (Robert Cooke, 1550-1615),
where he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He wrote <i>Censura Patrum</i> (London, 1623. 4<sup>o</sup>; 1614. 8<sup>o</sup>), but
it ought to be utterly rejected, along with Rivet's <i>Criticus</i>, Scultetus's
<i>Medulla</i>, the outburst of Hottinger, and similar commentaries
of the most virulent heretics, by all holding the Catholic
faith or it ought to be put far away in the castle of Hell, whence
it is forbidden to depart, along with the Magdeburg Centuriators,
Mathias Flaccius Illyricus, and the works of others that have
been assembled in several volumes. I hear also that a criticism
of ancient writers by the same Cooke was published at Helmstadt
in octavo in 1655.</p></blockquote>

<p>Labbé makes mistakes in details and perhaps more
mistakes than a modern bibliographer. We can easily
pardon minor troublesome mistakes in alphabetization. In
an index according to Christian names it is not fatal to
have the last name of Christophorus Ferg misspelled Freg.<a name="FNanchor_65_66" id="FNanchor_65_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_66" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Labbé should have eliminated many duplications like those
of Christophorus Giarda and Christophorus a Giarda or
Philibertus Fezaius and Philibertus Fresalius (the latter is
an error).</p>

<p>A comparison of Labbé's text with the indexes discloses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>serious discrepancies that reduce the value of his
book. One can usually go from the indexes to the text
without much trouble, although a few references lack the
name needed as a guide.<a name="FNanchor_66_67" id="FNanchor_66_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_67" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> A reverse comparison of the
text with the indexes is much less satisfactory and shows
that Labbé added names to the text after he had made
the indexes.<a name="FNanchor_67_68" id="FNanchor_67_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_68" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>We can justly object to Labbé's inclusion of subject
entries in an alphabet of authors.<a name="FNanchor_68_69" id="FNanchor_68_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_69" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Had he given more
thought to them, he would no doubt have hit upon the
idea of a dictionary catalogue of authors and subjects and
might have simplified the complicated indexes. His plan
required him to put subjects into the indexes, but he had
no good place to put an article "Bibliothecae." This contains
a classified list of catalogues and libraries that I shall
discuss in the next chapter. He put it in its alphabetical
place, in a list of names. A curious bibliography of fictitious
bibliographies is entered under "Fictae Bibliothecae."
When Labbé put a bibliography of guides to university
studies at the end of his alphabet of authors, he showed
his realization of the fact that he had no place for it.</p>

<p>As all bibliographers have at one time or another,
Labbé included some titles that had little to do with his
task. The differentiation of biography and bibliography
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>was perhaps less clear then than now, and general treatises
on scholarly matters probably seemed more closely akin to
bibliographies than we find them to be. Honoratus Montecalvus,
<i>Speculum tragicum Regum, Principum &amp; Magnatum
superioris seculi celebriorum ruinas exitusque calamitosos
breviter complectens</i>, which is adequately described
by its long title, is not a bibliography but one of many
accounts of the mishaps that have befallen great men.
Jacobus Gretser, <i>De jure et more prohibendi, expurgandi
et abolendi libros haereticos et noxios</i> is obviously a book
about books, but it is scarcely a bibliography. Although
Jacobus Middendorpius's famous treatise on universities
is a general account of its subject, Labbé is probably too
generous in admitting it. These examples suggest some
laxity in Labbé's definition of bibliography.</p>

<p>In its conception and execution the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>
is excellent. Although rarely consulted, it is
still valuable for reference purposes. An occasional difficulty
will arise, but a modern reader must not object to
Labbé's short titles.<a name="FNanchor_69_70" id="FNanchor_69_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_70" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> <i>Theatri</i>, which was then immediately
understood as a citation of Theodor Zwinger, the
Elder (ed.), <i>Theatrum vitae humanae</i>, a standard sixteenth-century
encyclopedia, was then no more difficult
to understand than <i>The New International</i> might be
today.<a name="FNanchor_70_71" id="FNanchor_70_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_71" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Labbé is a good bibliographer because he cites
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
pertinent references to non-bibliographical books.<a name="FNanchor_71_72" id="FNanchor_71_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_72" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> He is
careful to indicate whether he has seen the book he is
citing<a name="FNanchor_72_73" id="FNanchor_72_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_73" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and occasionally comments on its bibliographical
value.<a name="FNanchor_73_74" id="FNanchor_73_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_74" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>In brief, Labbé's <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> is well
conceived, neatly arranged, and relatively accurate in
details. In plan and arrangement it surpasses, for example,
such a modern work of similar size and purpose as <i>A
Bibliography of Bibliographies</i> that the famous bibliographer
Joseph Sabin published in 1877. As I have already
said, the references are as accurate as those to be found
in three of the bibliographies of bibliographies published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>in the last seventy years. His choice of an arrangement
according to authors' names has been adopted only by
Joseph Sabin (1877) and Léon Vallée (1883-1887). Unpopular
as it has been, it nevertheless seems to me a good
method of dealing with intractable material. A classified
bibliography requires both an index of subjects and an
index of authors. An alphabetical index of subjects requires
cross-references and an index of authors. Labbé's
<i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> needs only a new index of
subjects to become a reference work useful to a modern
scholar.</p>

<p>The time was not ripe for a bibliography of bibliographies
and Labbé's contemporaries and immediate successors
neither perceived the novelty of his idea nor fully
appreciated its value. Contemporary recommendations of
the book have a perfunctory flavor. Valentin Heinrich
Vogler, who wrote an admirable survey of scholarly books
entitled <i>Introductio universalis in notitiam cuiuscunque
bonorum scriptorum</i> (Helmstadt, 1670), is representative.
He passed a judgment on a book that he had not seen.
When Heinrich Meibom made a new edition of Vogler's
handbook in 1691, he summarized Vogler's comment and
having seen Labbé's book, added some characteristic and
interesting remarks of his own:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Vogler did not see it [the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>]. Nevertheless,
with only a few excerpts available to him, he did
not use bad judgment in saying that it offers only a brief
review of authors arranged according to their names<a name="FNanchor_74_75" id="FNanchor_74_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_75" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>makes no comments on the way in which these men have
dealt with their materials. Still, the work is very useful
(<i>Utilis tamen valde labor est</i>), although I have found many
authors cited, of whom some have no pertinence and others
tell the lives of men who are famous for their reputations
and deserts rather than in literary endeavors and writing.
From not a few entries it would also appear that he has
often not seen the books, but, deceived by the title, he has
nevertheless cited them. This is, for example, the case when
he cites David Frölich, <i>Viatorium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_75_76" id="FNanchor_75_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_76" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> And he does not
blush to make venomous remarks in his usual fashion about
some excellent men, especially those who differ from him
in religious matters.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meibom speaks harshly, and more harshly than Labbé
has deserved, but he does grudgingly acknowledge that
the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> is useful. Daniel Georg
Morhof, whose <i>Polyhistor</i>, a general treatise on university
studies, demanded some mention of indexes, bibliographies,
and reference works, expresses much the same
judgment on Labbé and leaves one in doubt whether he
has actually seen the book. In a chapter entitled "De
catalogorum scriptoribus," Morhof begins with general remarks
about the kinds of bibliographies that a scholar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>then had within his reach, but fails to identify clearly the
bibliography of bibliographies as a special variety. He
does, however, go on to say, "Like Hodegeta and Janus
Patulcis, Philip Labbé is vigilant at the very entrance to
learning."<a name="FNanchor_76_77" id="FNanchor_76_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_77" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> This means that he recognized Labbé's book
to be one of the first books to be consulted in undertaking
an investigation. He should have said more. Perhaps
Vogler, Meibom, and Morhof, whose acquaintance with the
<i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> seems superficial, knew it only
from book reviews, especially Denis de Sallo's review in <i>Le
Journal des sçavans</i>. Adrien Baillet, who quotes this review,
mentions also a brief notice by Henning Witte, who
seems to have an equally superficial knowledge of the
book.<a name="FNanchor_77_78" id="FNanchor_77_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_78" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>A few scholars did understand what Labbé had done.
Probably Vincent Placcius (1642-1699), who spent his life
in the study of anonyma and pseudonyma, would have continued
the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> in Labbé's spirit.<a name="FNanchor_78_79" id="FNanchor_78_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_79" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Theophilus [or Gottlieb] Spitzel (1639-1691), a very intelligent
bibliographer and theological writer of Augsburg,
gave more attention to the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> than
anyone else of his generation. He obtained it after considerable
delay and with some difficulty. After reading
the preface, in which Labbé explains his plan, he characterized
Labbé's flamboyance as "really gorgeous indeed (satis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>profecto splendidam Praefationem)."<a name="FNanchor_79_80" id="FNanchor_79_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_80" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> In order to justify
his criticism of the book, he reprinted the eighth index&mdash;a
list of men who had compiled bibliographies (<i>bibliothecae</i>)
and similar general works&mdash;and added a supplement to
show how many titles Labbé had overlooked. Spitzel's additions
amount to nearly one hundred titles, which are
grouped in sixty categories. They show that Spitzel understood
the true nature of a bibliography of bibliographies,
but they do not show the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> to be
seriously incomplete or unsatisfactory. Some additions&mdash;for
example, the Oriental bibliographies by Paul Colomies&mdash;were
published after Labbé had given the last touches to
his book or indeed after he had died. Others are bibliographies
hidden in non-bibliographical works. For example,
one can suspect his pleasure in adding "Joh. Nadasi, in
libro cui Tit. Annus dierum memorab. S. l. [sine loco] ed.
Antw. 1665"<a name="FNanchor_80_81" id="FNanchor_80_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_81" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> to the bibliographies of the Jesuits. Labbé
was a Jesuit and seems to have been caught napping, although
he had cited Rivadaneira's bibliography of the
Jesuits and had published his own bibliography of French
Jesuits. Spitzel did not point out that the first edition of
Labbé's book was printed in 1664, a year before the book
cited by Spitzel appeared, and that Labbé died in 1667, five
years before the second edition was published. Labbé could
not have included this title. Such victories are easy. Furthermore,
Spitzel did not learn to use Labbé's indexes. His
failure brings some comfort to a modern reader who does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>not find them very convenient. In his additions, for example,
Spitzel cites some bibliographies of medicine.
Labbé had found them, too, and had cited them in the first
index, where they properly belonged according to his plan.
Spitzel should have seen that Labbé cited Michele Poccianti's
list of Florentine authors and Cornelius Loos's list
of German authors in the right places.</p>

<p>A generation after Spitzel, J. F. Reimann (1668-1743),
a theologian and the author of several very curious surveys
of the history of learning, showed his full appreciation of
Labbé's <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>. His praise is significant
because he was not accustomed to stint himself in
condemning books that he did not like. In the <i>Versuch
einer Einleitung in die Historiam Litterariam, so wohl insgemein,
als auch in die Historiam Litterariam derer
Teutschen</i> (Halle, 1708-1713), he writes: "Let this book of
Labbé's be commended to you for diligent study above
all others, for (disregarding the obscenities, which are scattered
about in it like mouse dirt in pepper) it is one of the
very best works in the field [of general bibliography]." He
concludes his remarks on this field by recommending it a
second time, when he mentions along with it the anonymous
<i>Bibliographia Historico-politico-philologica curiosa</i>
as a meritorious work.<a name="FNanchor_81_82" id="FNanchor_81_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_82" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> After this, Labbé's book ceases to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>be mentioned because it was replaced by a new edition,
to which we now turn.</p>

<p>In 1686 Antoine Teissier (1632-1715), a Frenchman
who became historiographer at the court of Frederick I of
Prussia, published a revised and enlarged edition of Labbé's
<i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> and gave it a new title:
<i>Catalogus auctorum, qui librorum catalogos, indices, bibliothecas,
virorum literatorum elogia, vitas, aut orationes
funebres, scriptis consignarunt</i>. This new title, which he
signs "By Antoine Teissier (Ab Antonio Teisserio)," obscures
the fact that the <i>Catalogus</i> is essentially a new edition
of Labbé's bibliography. The title page gives credit
to Labbé only for an appendix entitled <i>Bibliotheca nummaria</i>.
Teissier could, to be sure, claim that his emphasis
on eulogies, biographies, and funeral orations representing
a category of biographical writings that Labbé had not included
amounted to a sufficiently large alteration to justify
a claim to authorship. We can at least say that he did not
treat his predecessor generously. In a preface addressed to
the reader he says that he has doubled the number of bibliographies
cited and has added twelve hundred biographical
works.<a name="FNanchor_82_83" id="FNanchor_82_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_83" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
He has made the <i>Catalogus</i> both an index to
biographies and a bibliography of bibliographies. He could
scarcely have added the biographies if he had fully perceived
the nature and usefulness of a bibliography of bibliographies.</p>

<p>Teissier was a diligent collector and a good organizer.
Although he has corrected errors and has filled in gaps in
the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>, he was not always as careful
as he should have been. He added two new indexes:
Index V (<i>Catalogus</i>, pp. 353-355), listing writers of biobibliographies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of miscellaneous scope (i.e., works that were
not restricted to men of a particular country or profession),
and Index X (<i>Catalogus</i>, pp. 364-400), listing the men who
were the subjects of biographies. These indexes show that
Teissier was chiefly interested in biography. He transferred
an index of last names that Labbé had given in the
preliminary pages to the end of the Catalogus and made
it Index XI. He showed bibliographical sense in perceiving
and remedying the serious difficulties that the references
to "Anonymus" in Labbé's indexes had caused. In
order to run them down in the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>
one must read the entire book. Teissier assembled all anonymous
works in a single place ("Auctores anonymi," pp.
319-332) and thus made it possible to identify a reference
rather easily. He removed the brief account of fictitious
libraries to a new place (<i>Catalogus</i>, p. 363) and added to
it a short but very interesting list of sixteen seventeenth-century
catalogues of private libraries.</p>

<p>Teissier did not learn from Labbé's experience that
titles should be cited in the original languages. Consequently,
the <i>Catalogus</i> offers the same mixture of Latin
titles translated from the vernacular and vernacular titles
as we found in the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>. Probably
he could not have achieved any substantial improvement in
this regard. He could not see many books that he cited and
the sources from which he took the titles usually gave them
in Latin translation. Like Labbé, he cited bibliographical
sections of non-bibliographical works.<a name="FNanchor_83_84" id="FNanchor_83_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_84" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> He made some
mistakes and corrected some that Labbé had made.<a name="FNanchor_84_85" id="FNanchor_84_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_85" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> His
most serious fault is his failure to verify his references. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>the seventeen pages devoted to authors whose first names
begin with "H" (<i>Catalogus</i>, pp. 121-138) Teissier cited
eight books with the remark "He is said to have written&mdash;(scripsisse
dicitur)." This number is much larger than it
should be. Since he usually neglects to cite his source
(Labbé is more careful in this regard), search for the title
may be difficult. He is often careless in details.<a name="FNanchor_85_86" id="FNanchor_85_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_86" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Teissier did not improve his technique in the <i>Auctuarium</i>,
a supplement published in 1705. This book of 388
pages contains many new bibliographies and substantial
additions to the indexes.<a name="FNanchor_86_87" id="FNanchor_86_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_87" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> He has turned up some new
bibliographers of classical times that had escaped Labbé
and were not included in his revision of 1686. For example,
he cites Xenocrates as the writer of a list of geometricians
and Varro as the writer of a list of poets. He has brought
up to date the list of English bibliographers by adding Henry
Holland, who is the H. H. of the <i>Herwologia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_87_88" id="FNanchor_87_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_88" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Richard
Smith, whose library was the subject of an early catalogue;
and William Winstanley, who wrote on English poets. He
knows "Rossus Warwicensus" from John Pits's biobibliographical
dictionary of English authors, but of course has
not seen Thomas Hearne's edition, which came out a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
years later.<a name="FNanchor_88_89" id="FNanchor_88_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_89" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He is as neglectful as he had been in the
<i>Catalogus</i> about giving dates and places of publication and
citing authorities for titles that he has not seen and works
in manuscript.</p>

<p>Labbé's original plan survived without substantial
change in Teissier's revision of 1686 and supplement of
1705. In the <i>Auctuarium</i>, the fourth index, "Writers on
Various Subjects (De variis argumentis scriptores)," has
grown enormously. If Teissier had given any attention to
remaking the structure of the book, it might have suggested
to him the idea of an alphabetical subject index. He has
no longer adhered strictly to listing bibliographies in terms
of men who specialized in various subjects but shifted somewhat
in the direction of an emphasis on the subject. He
could have introduced many practitioners of various arts
and sciences into the first index, but his decision to put
them into the fourth index shows a breaking down of the
scheme that Labbé had invented. When he says (<i>Auctuarium</i>,
p. 398) that the seventh index will supplement the list
of library catalogues, which are in the eighth index, he is
confessing to uncertainty about the scheme. Wavering of
this sort is evidence that he did not fully understand the
scheme or did not choose to adhere to it.</p>

<p>Although scholars no longer remember Antoine Teissier
and his bibliographies, the <i>Catalogus</i> and the <i>Auctuarium</i>
offer a uniquely useful summary of seventeenth-century
scholarship. In them we find such bibliographies
as a list of twenty-two medical bibliographers (<i>Auctuarium</i>,
p. 288), fifteen writers (<i>Catalogus</i>, p. 349) on academies
and universities (these authors are scarcely bibliographers,
but contemporary practice did not separate them sharply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>from bibliographers), twenty compilers of catalogues of
manuscripts (<i>Catalogus</i>, p. 352), twenty authors of lists
of famous women (<i>Catalogus</i>, p. 352), and four bibliographers
of dictionaries (<i>Auctuarium</i>, p. 298).<a name="FNanchor_89_90" id="FNanchor_89_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_90" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> There is
even a reference to a bibliographer of books of anagrams.<a name="FNanchor_90_91" id="FNanchor_90_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_91" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The reception of Labbé's and Teissier's books shows
that the world was not ready for a bibliography of
bibliographies. We can see additional evidence to this
effect in the announcement in 1680 of a bibliography of
bibliographies that did not get into print. Cornelius a
Beughem (fl. 1678-1710), a Dutch bookseller who compiled
and published several bibliographies, borrowed the
title <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> from Labbé and the title
<i>Bibliothecariographia</i> from Dudinck for books that never
got into print. Presumably the <i>Bibliothecariographia</i> was a
treatise on library science. In his subtitle Beughem makes
clear what he intended to include in the <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>.
It was to be <i>An Account and Fuller Listing
of all Books and Works that Have Appeared up till now
under the Titles Bibliotheca (Bibliography), Catalogus, Index,
Athenae, etc.</i><a name="FNanchor_91_92" id="FNanchor_91_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_92" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> We can perhaps infer that he did not
include bibliographies published in non-bibliographical
works. His bibliographies of incunabula and of medical,
juridical, and historical writings as well as his survey of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>articles in journals (a Poole's <i>Index</i> at the end of the
seventeenth century!) show him to have been a most diligent
worker.<a name="FNanchor_92_93" id="FNanchor_92_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_93" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> We can only regret his failure to print his
two books on bibliography and library science.</p>

<p>With Cornelius a Beughem's unfulfilled promise of
a <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>, Antoine Teissier's <i>Catalogus</i>
and <i>Auctuarium</i>, and Charles Moëtte's lost manuscript
bibliography of bibliographies that I shall mention in
Chapter IV, the making of bibliographies of bibliographies
came to a temporary end shortly after 1700. Scholars do
not seem to have esteemed Teissier's books very highly
then or later and Teissier himself concealed their nature
by including a large number of biographies. The tentative
efforts to write lists of books entitled <i>Bibliotheca</i> that might
have developed into bibliographies of bibliographies are
the subject of the next chapter, but it may be said in
advance that they had no important result.</p>

<p>Explanations for the disappearance of bibliographies
of bibliographies around 1700 are readily found. Even a
casual reading of the subject indexes to Labbé or Teissier
reveals few themes to attract eighteenth-century scholars,
who were studying theological, political, economic, historical,
literary, and scientific problems in new ways. The
great encyclopedias, of which Moréri's <i>Le Grand dictionnaire</i>,
first published at Lyons in 1674 and revised, enlarged,
and supplemented down to 1759, is typical, gave
scholars information that they might otherwise have sought
in bibliographies. The changes in the intellectual climate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>around 1700 are too varied and numerous to discuss here.
It is enough to note that they included the disappearance
of bibliographies of bibliographies from the list of scholarly
tools.</p>

<small>Lists of Books Entitled "Bibliotheca"</small></h2>


<p>The listing of books that contain the word <i>Bibliotheca</i>
in their titles is a special bibliographical development in
the seventeenth century and continues into the eighteenth.
It might have led by easy stages to making a bibliography
of bibliographies, but it unfortunately attracted little notice
and maintained a tenuous existence for only about a
century. The word <i>bibliotheca</i>, which often appears in
titles, has such more or less bibliographical meanings as
bibliography, subject index, catalogue of a public or private
library, and collection of materials dealing with a particular
subject. Consequently, a list of books entitled <i>bibliotheca</i>
has much in common with a list of reference works and,
more particularly, a bibliography of bibliographies. Although
there was no proper place for such a list in his <i>Bibliotheca
bibliothecarum</i>, Philip Labbé included one under
the heading <i>Bibliotheca</i> in an alphabet of authors.<a name="FNanchor_93_94" id="FNanchor_93_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_94" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This
is an early example of a list of books chosen according
to their titles.</p>

<p>Labbé limited himself strictly to works of a bibliographical
nature. He did not, for example, include the
collections of the church fathers that were very familiar
to him, although they bore the title <i>Bibliotheca</i>. Many
books that he cites are hard to identify: some titles seem
to have been made up and others refer to books that were
never printed. Labbé uses the term <i>bibliotheca</i> so loosely
that we do not always know whether he is referring to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>library and its catalogue (for example, <i>Bibliotheca Augustana</i>
may mean the library or may be a short title for its
catalogue) or a book (for example, Conrad Gesner's <i>Bibliotheca
universalis</i>). In either case, he is thinking as a
bibliographer, and we can easily conceive the enlargement
of his list into a bibliography of bibliographies.</p>

<p>Labbé's classification of books entitled <i>bibliotheca</i>
shows a remarkable understanding of their different kinds
and calls attention to their remarkable variety. I cannot
easily cite an equally instructive and suggestive review of
bibliographies.<a name="FNanchor_94_95" id="FNanchor_94_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_95" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Labbé's classification is as follows: (1)

<p>The anonymous author of <i>The Newly Opened Library
(Die neu-eröffnete Bibliothec), in which good information
about libraries as well as convenient directions for acquiring,
maintaining, and using them are put into the hands
of students and inquiring friends. To which are added:
the chief European libraries and what travelers ought to
notice in visits to them</i> (1702) hit upon the same idea of
listing <i>bibliothecae</i>.<a name="FNanchor_112_113" id="FNanchor_112_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_113" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In this book a special section or appendix
labelled "A List of Authors Who Have Written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Books Entitled 'Bibliotheca' and Books about Libraries
(Series Authorum qui Bibliothecas &amp; de Bibliothecis scripserunt)"
names books called <i>bibliotheca</i>, catalogues of
libraries, and treatises on library science. The selection is
obviously even more definitely bibliographical in character
than Labbé's list had been. The compiler arranges the titles
alphabetically according to the author's last names or, in
the case of an anonymous work, according to an important
word in the title. This arrangement and the choice of titles
show that he had no knowledge of Labbé. Like Labbé, he
includes none of the collections of texts that were entitled
<i>bibliotheca</i>.</p>

<p>Our author begins with Valerius Andreas, <i>Bibliotheca
Belgica</i> (1643), a biobibliographical dictionary of writers
in the Low Countries. In the letter "A" he includes the
<i>Augustanae Bibliothecae Catalogus</i> (1633), which he also
enters under the name of the compiler, Elias Ehinger, librarian
at Augsburg. He cites the <i>Bibliothèque universelle</i>,
a critical journal edited by Jean Leclerc, because the
title contains the word <i>Bibliothèque</i>. Such titles show that
he was thinking in bibliographical terms, for Andreas's
book and the Augsburg catalogue are bibliographies and
Leclerc's journal was a review of current publications.</p>

<p>The titles in this list are interesting because some are
rarely mentioned and others are difficult to track down.
Examples are "Augusti sereniss. Ducis Brunsvicensis Bibliothecae
Sciagraphia, Bibliothecae Catalogus. Wolfenb.
1650. in 4-to;"<a name="FNanchor_113_114" id="FNanchor_113_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_114" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> "Henricii Furenii Bibliotheca Medica."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Hafn. 1659. in 4-to;<a name="FNanchor_114_115" id="FNanchor_114_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_115" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> "Hamburgensis Bibliothecae scripta
memoria." Hamb. 1651. fol.;<a name="FNanchor_115_116" id="FNanchor_115_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_116" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and Bartol. "Moseri Thesaurus
Bibliatricus seu Bibliotheca gemina Onomastica &amp;
Classica." Dilingii. fol.<a name="FNanchor_116_117" id="FNanchor_116_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_117" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
The list includes a few autobibliographies,
for example, those written by such librarians
and bibliographers as Peter Lambeck (Lambecius) and
Philip Labbé. The most surprising title that the compiler
names is "Joan. Brunderii [sic] index librorum MS quae in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Bibliothecis Belgicis extant."<a name="FNanchor_117_118" id="FNanchor_117_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_118" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> This union catalogue of
manuscripts owned in the Low Countries was made by the
Belgian Dominican Johannes Bunderius or Bunderus (b.
1481 or 1482, d. 1557). Down to 1666 it is mentioned occasionally
by men who had consulted it, but our author
probably never saw it and no fragment of it is known to
have survived the dispersal of Anton Sander's library. A
reference to such a manuscript was by no means an idle
display of erudition. Allusions in various seventeenth-century
works show that men used this union catalogue. For
example, the Spaniard Pedro de Alva y Astorga, the author
of several very rare encyclopedic works, which were published
at Madrid and Louvain, drew upon it, and the Italian
Antonio Possevino quoted it in his <i>Apparatus sacer</i>.</p>

<p>This curious list in <i>Die neu-eröffnete Bibliothec</i> shows
some signs of carelessness. Its compiler has not seen all
the books in it. For example, he assigns Petrus Bertius's
catalogue of the university library at Leyden to 1591 instead
of 1595 (this error is probably a slip of the pen) and
mentions the famous ghosts announced by Jodocus a Dudinck.
He credits the <i>Philobiblon</i> to both Richard de Bury
and Richard Dunelmensis (De Bury's name as Bishop of
Durham). With all its faults, this "Series" is nevertheless
a respectable piece of work by a man who saw clearly the
nature of a bibliography of bibliographies.</p>

<p>A generation later, in 1734, Johannes Gottfried Unger
published a pamphlet entitled <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><i>De libris bibliothecarum
nomine notatis</i>, a classified list of books entitled <i>bibliotheca</i>,
and added critical and descriptive comments. Julius
Petzholdt, who is often a severe judge, deals with it generously,
when he says (p. 79) that it is worth a glance and
can then be forgotten. Although he seems to be unaware
of any predecessor, Unger's idea was not novel. His execution
of the idea leaves much to be desired. Since his
list contains few, if any, books that cannot be easily found
elsewhere, his list has little value and his comments do not
enrich it. His strict adherence to the task of collecting
books entitled <i>bibliotheca</i> prevented him from seeing the
possible greater usefulness of what he was doing.</p>

<p>After some general remarks on libraries and bibliographies
and a definition of the task, Unger cites seven
general works: Labbé's <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> (he
mentions here Teissier's <i>Catalogus</i> and <i>Auctuarium</i>, but he
has not seen them); G. M. König, <i>Bibliotheca vetus et nova</i>;
Latinus Latinius, <i>Bibliotheca sacra et profana</i>; Jean Leclerc,
<i>Bibliothèque universelle et historique</i> (this is the
<i>Bibliothèque universelle</i> and its continuation, the <i>Bibliothèque
historique</i>); Conrad Gesner, <i>Bibliotheca universalis</i>;
Johannes Groeningius, <i>Bibliotheca s[ive] codex operum
variorum</i>; and Louis Ellies DuPin, <i>Bibliothèque universelle
des historiens</i>. "And these are the books entitled Universal
Library or: Bibliography." His comments contain some
information but do not on the whole show much familiarity
with the books. For example, the remarks on König's late
seventeenth-century biobibliographical dictionary are lifted
from D. G. Morhof, <i>Polyhistor</i>. He points out that the subtitle
of Latinius's <i>Bibliotheca</i> gives a good idea of its contents:
"Observationes, correctiones et variae lectiones in
sacros et profanos scriptores, ex marginalibus notis codicum
ejusdem [Latini Latinii] a Dominco Marco editae." In
other words, the book is a miscellany of emendations and
critical comments rather than a bibliography. He describes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Leclerc's journals by a long quotation from the preface to
the first volume. They are, he thinks, a better example of
this genre of books than Latinius's collectanea. He dismisses
Gesner's <i>Bibliotheca universalis</i> with the remark that
it "also deserves mention (praeterea notatu digna est)" and
a reference to Morhof, <i>Polyhistor</i>. He does not describe
the book by Johannes Groeningius.<a name="FNanchor_118_119" id="FNanchor_118_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_119" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Unger's account of forty-one theological bibliographies
and collections of texts entitled <i>bibliotheca</i> is not altogether
bad. He often quotes the titles of chapters from these
books or says that a book is a collection of texts and not a
bibliography. Much of this information was even then
available in well-organized reference works, and Unger's
only contribution is the selecting of the books entitled <i>bibliotheca</i>.
His account of legal bibliographies begins with
Martin Lipenius, <i>Bibliotheca juridica</i>, "which was published
at Frankfurt in 1607 as a folio and was enlarged by
F. G. Struve in 1720." This is not a good start, for the first
date is wrong (it should be 1679) and he would have
found five more legal bibliographies entitled <i>bibliotheca</i>
by opening Lipenius. In this category he cites nine more
titles, counting three works by Caspar Thurmann as one
book. This combination is not particularly objectionable.
Thurmann had made a classified legal bibliography and
finding no publisher, had printed portions as small bibliographies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>Unger then proceeds to historical, medical,
and philosophical categories, but we need follow him no
further. He finally resigns himself to naming titles in a
confused order. His disappointing performance has the
merit of naming books called <i>bibliotheca</i>, but it does not
suggest, as Labbé and the anonymous author of <i>Die neu-eröffnete
Bibliothec</i> had done, that they were primarily
interesting as bibliographies.</p>

<p>The sixty folio pages (double columns) filled with entries
beginning with the word <i>bibliotheca</i> in Michael a San
José, <i>Bibliographia critica</i> (1740-1742) have the appearance
of a list of books, but on closer examination many
titles prove to be made up. In other words, San José offers
what amounts to a general survey of bibliography. Since
his book is almost unknown and the entries are often curious,
a brief description will not be out of place. The articles
are arranged alphabetically according to the adjective
that follows the word <i>bibliotheca</i>. Thus, the list begins
with J. F. Reimann, <i>Bibliotheca acroamatica</i> (Hannover,
1712), a condensation of Peter Lambeck's catalogue of
manuscripts in the Imperial Library at Vienna. The next
entry consists of two columns headed "Bibliotheca Adriani
Baillet" and is a brief discussion of the <i>Jugemens des
savans</i> (1685-1686) and a long summary of a prospectus
of a philosophical dictionary that Baillet planned but never
published. More entries follow in an alphabetical order
according to proper names or adjectives derived from proper
names or the subject matter. Laurentius de Cremona,
<i>Bibliotheca aethiopica</i> is entered under "Aethiopica," and
Albert Bartholin, <i>Liber de scriptis Danorum</i> under "Alberti."
It is difficult to discover the plan of arrangement, and
equally difficult to see the reasons for choosing the books.
The presence of more than twenty entries entitled "Bibliotheca
Biblica" is not surprising, but eleven botanical bibliographies
and twelve pages summarizing the Linnean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
classification seem an unnecessarily generous allotment to
that subject. A few pages later San José cites collective
works&mdash;not bibliographies&mdash;that deal with <span class="gesperrt">Byzantine</span>
history and canon law, but he ordinarily limits himself to
bibliographies and biobibliographies. He shows no sense
of proportion in the choice of titles. Out of hundreds of
regional biobibliographies he chooses one for Naumburg
for mention. It can have meant very little to most readers
of his book, and he might have omitted it. A "Bibliotheca
occulta concionum P. Paulini a S. Joseph" (Rome, 1720)
did not deserve three pages or a revision of Antonio León
Pinelo, <i>Epitome</i> (an early bibliography of American subjects)
five. San José is careless with names and titles.
Martin Hancke, the writer of a Silesian biobibliography
(p. 528), acquires an Oriental look, when he is called Han
Kii. San José's strange medley may yield a curious bit of
information now and again, but it need not detain us longer.</p>

<p>The last list of books entitled <i>bibliotheca</i> is the <i>Dissertation
sur les bibliothèques</i> (1758) by J. D. Durey de
Noinville (1683-1768).<a name="FNanchor_119_120" id="FNanchor_119_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_120" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> He does not hold to the purpose
announced in the heading "Alphabetical list of both works
published under the title of <i>bibliothèque</i> and printed catalogues
of collections in France and foreign countries."<a name="FNanchor_120_121" id="FNanchor_120_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_121" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
He offers virtually a bibliography of bibliographies. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>use of an asterisk to mark works containing an alphabetical
index of authors shows some bibliographical sense, but the
lack of a clear plan of selection and organization makes
the book unusable. In a hodgepodge of seven hundred
and fifty titles&mdash;I take the figure from Besterman&mdash;Durey
de Noinville may list a book according to its author or its
subject without any apparent reason for his choice of either
method. His knowledge of available bibliographies is entirely
inadequate. The accounts of reference books dealing
with Belgium, church history and France are scanty,<a name="FNanchor_121_122" id="FNanchor_121_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_122" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> the
list of learned journals is almost worthless,<a name="FNanchor_122_123" id="FNanchor_122_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_123" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and the remarks
about journals entitled <i>Mercure</i> exceed somewhat
the scope of his enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_123_124" id="FNanchor_123_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_124" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> In addition to these faults
Durey de Noinville makes bad mistakes in details.<a name="FNanchor_124_125" id="FNanchor_124_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_125" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> His
virtually worthless compilation yields an occasional nugget,
but such discoveries are rare.<a name="FNanchor_125_126" id="FNanchor_125_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_126" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> His book is only interesting
or important for showing how a bibliography of bibliographies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>might have grown out of a list of books entitled
<i>bibliotheca</i>.</p>

<p>The efforts that we have surveyed in this chapter
produced nothing of lasting value. The list written by the
author of <i>Die neu-eröffnete Bibliothec</i> did not lead to
either a bibliography of bibliographies or a guide to reference
works. Durey de Noinville's disorderly book was not
good enough to suggest making anything better. All these
writers worked independently and made little or no use
of their predecessors. We might see in this fact an omen
of the course of bibliographies of bibliographies in the
next century.</p>

<small>The Bibliography of Bibliographies
Begins Anew</small></h2>


<p>Comprehensive authoritative bibliographies of the
most popular fields of scholarship are characteristic products
of the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_126_127" id="FNanchor_126_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_127" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> They began to appear
in the last years of the seventeenth century, when Giulio
Bartolocci (1613-1687) published the <i>Bibliotheca magna
rabbinica</i> (3 v.; 1675-1693) which Carlo Giuseppe Imbonati
(d. after 1696) completed and provided with the
supplementary <i>Bibliotheca latino-hebraica</i> (1694). There
are many standard bibliographies to set beside it. Barthélemy
d'Herbelot [de Molainville] compiled the <i>Bibliothèque
orientale</i> in 1697, Johann Albert Fabricius published
the first edition of the <i>Bibliotheca latina</i> in the same
year and continued with such larger and more important
works as the <i>Bibliotheca mediae et infimae latinitatis</i> (6
v.; 1734-1746) and his masterpiece, the <i>Bibliotheca graeca</i>
(14 v.; 1705-1728). In 1693 Ellies Du Pin published the
first volume of the long theological bibliography that only
his death was to interrupt. Many of these works were
revised and enlarged during the next century and a half.
The <i>Bibliothèque orientale</i> was republished for the last
time in 1781-1783. An edition of the even more successful
<i>Bibliotheca latina</i> was begun in 1773 and remained incomplete.
The new edition of the <i>Bibliotheca graeca</i> begun
in 1790 was brought to an end, although the work
was still incomplete, with an index published in 1838.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Excellent bibliographies which are still worth consulting
were written for every subject of particular interest to
eighteenth-century scholars. J. C. Wolf published four
thick volumes of a <i>Bibliotheca hebraea</i> in 1715-1733. William
Cave, who had begun his bibliographical activities
in the seventeenth century, Jacques LeLong, and (after
the middle of the century) J. G. Walch satisfied the demands
of theologians. Langlet du Fresnoy, Johann Burkhard
Mencken, and B. G. Struve compiled exhaustive lists
of historical materials and investigations. The many bibliographies
by Johann Albert Fabricius reviewed such subjects
as church history, missions, and classical, Christian,
Jewish, and heathen antiquities. In brief, the eighteenth-century
scholar had on his shelves excellent bibliographies
of the subjects that he found most interesting. However,
he did not have any good guide to them in the form of
a bibliography of bibliographies.<a name="FNanchor_127_128" id="FNanchor_127_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_128" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>The only bibliography of bibliographies that can be
dated in the eighteenth century has, as far as I know,
disappeared entirely. It is a manuscript dated 1707 that
was sold at Amsterdam in 1743. From the brief auctioneer's
description we can infer that it resembled Labbé's
<i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> and was a continuation of that
bibliographical tradition. I have been unable to learn
anything about its author. The description is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bibliotheca Alphabetica à Carolo Moëtte collecta
cum Indice Auctorum, Parisiis 1707. NB.
Opus hoc propriè est Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum,
MSS. ineditum.<a name="FNanchor_128_129" id="FNanchor_128_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_129" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Each epoch in the history of bibliographies of bibliographies
has an individuality of its own. In the hands
of Conrad Gesner and his successors this variety of bibliography
slowly established itself. In the next epoch the
work of Philip Labbé attracted contemporary scholars to
continue and improve it. Although Antoine Teissier was
the only one to publish the revision of a predecessor's
work, his procedure is characteristic of seventeenth-century
scholarship. The eighteenth century neglected the
bibliography of bibliographies and let the writings of
the sixteenth and seventeenth century in this field sink
into obscurity. In the nineteenth century, as we shall see,
men undertook to compile bibliographies of bibliographies
with an astonishing disregard of the difficulties of the
task and a surprising neglect of previous efforts. Without
an exception these men were librarians and should therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>have been fully aware of what they were doing and
of what had been done. Their behavior is nothing less
than amazing. I may anticipate the theme of the next
chapter by saying that the characteristic aspect of the
making of bibliographies of bibliographies in the twentieth
century is cooperation.</p>

<p>When the great French bibliographer Gabriel Peignot
(1767-1849) published his <i>Répertoire bibliographique générale</i>
in 1812, he declared that he had hit upon an entirely
new idea. Although he knew and cited such predecessors
as Labbé and Teissier, he did not clearly see that he was
undertaking the task that they had already completed.
He did not use their books systematically, and he did not
exhaust the information that they had collected.</p>

<p>Peignot shows his competence as a bibliographer in
various ways. Like his predecessors (although he seems
not to have intentionally imitated them), he includes bibliographies
printed as parts of non-bibliographical works.
For example, he quotes at the very beginning a bibliography
of books about bees from a local agricultural journal.
Within the various articles he arranges the titles
chronologically and thus suggests the historical growth
of knowledge and bibliography in a particular field. Although
bibliographers before him had often added comments,
Peignot is more systematic and generous than his
predecessors. For example, his account of bibliographies
of ana&mdash;a subject to which he had himself made an
important contribution a few years before the publication
of the <i>Répertoire</i>&mdash;even includes useful references to
book reviews. Particularly interesting as a technical improvement
in bibliographical method are his frequent
references to the number of titles in the book that he is
citing. Bibliographies published before the <i>Répertoire</i>
rarely give this information. During the course of the
history that we have surveyed, the standards of accuracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and completeness rose and Peignot attains a very high
level in this regard. The index of authors in his <i>Répertoire</i>
is both complete and accurate and so, also, are his citations
of titles.</p>

<p>Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i> contains perhaps a thousand
articles extending from "Abeilles (bees)" to "Zoologie."
According to Theodore Besterman, it names two thousand
bibliographies. Since Peignot is primarily interested in
surveying eighteenth-century scholarship, he does not exhaust
Labbé's <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> and its continuations.</p>

<p>Peignot's decision to arrange his bibliography of bibliographies
in an alphabet of many small subject headings
has necessarily reduced the permanent value of his labors
or, more correctly, has made it more difficult for us to
benefit from them. The <i>Répertoire</i> suffers from the unavoidable
difficulties that arise from the choice of headings.<a name="FNanchor_129_130" id="FNanchor_129_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_130" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
A reader can never know whether a particular subject
will appear as a separate entry or as a subdivision of
a larger field. Will heresy stand alone or under theology?
What will the term philosophy include? Peignot gives no
cross-references to aid his reader. Nor is there an alphabetical
subject index that would guide the reader to the
bibliographies included in the larger headings. Such an
alphabetical subject index would have been useful, but
I grant at once that an alphabetical subject index to an
alphabetical list of subjects seems a strange duplication.
There is, to be sure, a brief classified subject index (pp.
xv-xix).</p>

<p>A serious and inescapable handicap to the permanent
usefulness of Peignot's alphabetical list of many small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>headings is the rapid obsolescence of technical terms. In
some cases we can no longer know exactly what Peignot
meant by a particular term and therefore cannot immediately
turn to a desired entry. For example, "histoire littéraire"
does not mean the history of literature or at least
of literature in the sense of belles lettres. In Peignot's use
"métaphysique" includes demonology or, as a modern
bookseller would say, "occult" books. A specialist in the
history of theological studies will know that Peignot's
"théologie positive" refers to theology based on God's revelations
to man, but two professors in a divinity school did
not recognize the term. I am all the more sympathetic
with them when I read in Neville Braybrooke's account
of Christianity in England the comment on Mr. Billy
Graham: "In his way he stood for 'positive theology'."&mdash;Cited
from <i>The Commonweal</i>, LX (1954), 194. Here the
term seems to mean "a convincing religion for the man
in the street."</p>

<p>Peignot does not offer an index of subjects because
he believes that his table of contents and his alphabetical
arrangement make it unnecessary. This belief is not well-founded
because he subdivides many long articles and
gives no cross-references and no indication of subdivisions
in the table of contents. The bibliography of an individual
classical author appears in its alphabetical place in the
article "Classiques" (pp. 155-244) and of a religious order
in "Ordres monastiques" (pp. 432-437). Without a cross-reference
from "Bible" (pp. 26-32) one will perhaps fail
to find a list of polyglot Bibles under the heading "Polyglottes"
(p. 447). It is not immediately obvious that
Peignot has arranged his valuable list (pp. 40-75) of catalogues
of public libraries alphabetically according to
places. He would have added little to the size of his book
by adding cross-references and he would have made it
much easier to use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Peignot feels the temptation that comes to
every bibliographer to wander afield and include works
of little pertinence to the task, he apologizes for yielding
to it in a prefatory "Nota" to the useful article "Bibliothèques"
(pp. 32-135). He includes here such works as
Richard de Bury, <i>Philobiblon</i> (a book about collecting
books); Claudius Clement, <i>Musaei</i> (a general treatise on
library science that contains little bibliographical information);
and Louis Jacob, <i>Traicté des plus belles bibliothèques</i>
(an excellent account of European libraries in
the early seventeenth century). In general, however,
Peignot adheres very strictly to his intention of listing
only bibliographies.</p>

<p>We must look with a critical eye at Peignot's classification.
Since he has an article on the bibliography of
bibliographies, he should not put Labbé, <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>,
in "Des livres en général" (p. 387). Boulard's
treatise on bibliographical method stands on the border
of what is admissible and should certainly not be placed
with "Des livres rares," a list of catalogues of rare books
(p. 396). Georg Draud, <i>Bibliotheca classica</i>, a classified
compilation of titles listed in the semi-annual catalogues
of the German booktrade, includes juridical works as a
matter of course, but it is not correctly placed in "Droit"
(p. 254). Anton Francesco Doni's <i>La libraria</i> is a catalogue
of Italian books and is not, as Peignot lists it (p.
95), a catalogue of a private library.</p>

<p>Peignot has seen many of the books that he cites
and in this regard surpasses his predecessors. He does
not, however, report German authors' names and titles
(even titles written in Latin) with satisfactory accuracy.<a name="FNanchor_130_131" id="FNanchor_130_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_131" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>I am not disposed to judge him very harshly for this fault
because the language was no doubt strange to him and
the books were probably not available. A more serious
fault is, it seems to me, his neglect of obviously important
books that he either could have seen or should have
known. I cannot understand how he overlooked such
authorities on church history and theology as Louis Ellies
Du Pin, Jacques LeLong, and J. G. Walch. He knows
only two of the six eighteenth-century bibliographies of
diplomatics that Namur commends (pp. xvii-xix), but all
of them are, it must be acknowledged, German works and
therefore probably not within his reach.</p>

<p>These comments on Peignot's faults can easily obscure
our estimate of his merits. His succinct and abundant
comments were no doubt useful when he wrote and are
still valuable. His chronological arrangement of titles is
a spur to historical meditations on the development of
many fields of study. A modern scholar finds it hard to
duplicate some information that Peignot has assembled.
Where else can he easily find bibliographies of the collections
of Latin poets,<a name="FNanchor_131_132" id="FNanchor_131_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_132" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
dictionaries,<a name="FNanchor_132_133" id="FNanchor_132_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_133" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
encyclopedias,<a name="FNanchor_133_134" id="FNanchor_133_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_134" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
translators of the classics,<a name="FNanchor_134_135" id="FNanchor_134_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_135" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and accounts of royal and noble
writers?<a name="FNanchor_135_136" id="FNanchor_135_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_136" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> His review of bibliographies of incunabula lays
a foundation for a history of such works,<a name="FNanchor_136_137" id="FNanchor_136_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_137" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and so also
does his survey of bibliographies of medicine.<a name="FNanchor_137_138" id="FNanchor_137_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_138" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The most
amusing list in Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i> is a collection of bibliographies
of men who practised trades or were members
of professions having little connection with literature.<a name="FNanchor_138_139" id="FNanchor_138_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_139" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Peignot's abundant and informative critical notes deserve
special praise. For example, he comments on catalogues
of public libraries (pp. 40-75), and although we
have longer lists of these catalogues, his comments have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>not been superseded. A modern cataloguer would probably
have separated the catalogues of manuscripts from
the catalogues of books. An even more important survey
deals with catalogues of private libraries (pp. 75-135) arranged
according to the owners' names. He tells the number
of lots offered for sale, remarks on the presence or
absence of indexes, and warns us when the catalogue was
printed in a small edition. He praises the superb <i>Catalogus
Bibliothecae Bunavianae</i> (p. 86), calls attention to
varying editions of the Cambis catalogue (pp. 87-88), and
commends the Imperiali catalogue (pp. 104-105). He
points out the noteworthy collections of journals entitled
<i>Mercure</i> and books on the theatre in the Pompadour catalogue
(p. 119). He often notes the use of a novel system
of classification. One could only wish that Peignot had
devoted even more effort to this list. He would have
enriched the comments and would have eliminated various
works that are not properly included among catalogues
of private libraries.<a name="FNanchor_139_140" id="FNanchor_139_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_140" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>In sum, then, Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i> represents a definite
advance in the progress of bibliographies of bibliographies
for its relative accuracy and its abundant comments.
It is what he intended it to be: a survey of eighteenth-century
bibliography rather than a comprehensive
bibliography of bibliographies.</p>

<p>Pie Namur, who wrote a very large bibliography of
bibliographies a short generation after Peignot, regarded
the <i>Répertoire</i> and two contemporary compilations by T.
H. Horne and A. F. Delandine as his only predecessors.
Although these compilations are brief selective lists of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>sort not included in this essay, Namur's recognition of
them makes it necessary to characterize them briefly.</p>

<p>The bibliographical portion (pp. 403-758) of Thomas
Hartwell Horne (1780-1862), <i>An Introduction to the Study
of Bibliography</i> (1814) is mentioned here only because
Pie Namur, the author of a bibliography of bibliographies
next to be discussed, names it along with A. F. Delandine's
"Bibliographie spéciale" and Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i> as a
predecessor. Like other writers of handbooks of bibliography,
Horne cites bibliographies without aiming at
completeness. Horne's Part III, "A Notice of the Principal
Works, Extant on Literary History in General, and on
Bibliography in Particular," gives the information that it
promises but contains no subject bibliographies and therefore
cannot be called a general bibliography of bibliographies.
It contains a brief account of "Dictionaries of
Literary History" or works that we would call universal
biobibliographies (pp. 403-408). The interesting survey
of "Treatises, &amp;c. on Literary History" (pp. 408-418) includes
G. M. König, <i>Bibliotheca vetus et nova</i> (1678)
and J. P. Niceron, <i>Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire des
hommes illustres dans la république des lettres</i> (43 v.;
1726-1745) that should have appeared in the preceding
section and two histories of philosophy for which his plan
had no place. "Writers on British Literary History" (pp.
419-431) and "Writers on Foreign Literary History" (pp.
431-447) are accounts of national biobibliographies, histories,
and bibliographies of literature, and of specialized
biobibliographical writings. One finds in them occasional
titles of infrequent occurrence like Christopher Wordsworth,
<i>Ecclesiastical Biography, or Lives of eminent men
connected with the history of religion in England, from
the commencement of the Reformation to the Revolution</i>
(6 v.; London, 1810) or Giovanni Agostini, <i>Notizie istorico-scritiche
intorno la vita e le opere degli scrittori Vineziani</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
(2 v.; Venice, 1752). His rather full account of British
works has some value but his incomplete foreign list is
noteworthy chiefly for such curiosities as Matthias Bellus,
<i>Exercitatio de vetere litteratura Hunno-Scythica</i> (pp. 433-434)
or Giambattista Toderini, <i>Della letteratura turchesa</i>
(p. 447). Horne devotes the following sections to writers
on the materials used in writing and printing (pp. 448-450),
writers on the origin of languages, letters, and writing
(pp. 451-469), and writers on the history and the art of
printing (pp. 469-513). A strictly bibliographical "Chapter
IV. Books" (pp. 513-550) contains books on bibliomania,
handbooks of bibliography, catalogues of rare books and
incunabula, dictionaries of anonyma and pseudonyma, and
lists of burned, suppressed, or censured books. The most
valuable part of Horne's <i>Introduction</i> is the fifth chapter,
on bibliographical systems and catalogues. The account
of bibliographical systems (pp. 551-563) is not very important,
but the review of British and foreign public and
private library catalogues (pp. 564-733) has not been entirely
superseded. Although far from complete, it contains
information not easily found elsewhere. It resembles
Peignot's similar review, on which Horne has drawn heavily.
He concludes with a brief survey of publishers' catalogues
(pp. 733-741), references (pp. 741-742) to two of
Peignot's bibliographies that he believes to be adequate
guides to subject bibliography, and addenda (pp. 743-758).
Horne did not intend his <i>Introduction</i> to be a bibliography
of bibliographies and we need say no more about
it.</p>

<p>A "Bibliographie spéciale et chronologique des principaux
ouvrages sur l'imprimerie et la bibliologie" by Antoine
François Delandine (1756-1820) is printed in his
<i>Bibliothèque de Lyons</i> (Paris, 1816). I have not seen Delandine's
original list but have used a later and slightly enlarged
version. In this, Etienne Psaume has, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Namur, added a few books printed between 1812 and 1822
and the new title "Appendice de l'Essai sur la bibliologie"
(1824). This, is an annotated chronological list of nearly
three hundred and fifty books on the history of printing,
catalogues of public and private libraries, and bibliographies
of miscellaneous scope. This somewhat casual
performance is useful at best for a few curious or informative
notes. The bibliographies do not amount to many
more than a hundred and do not offer either in number or
variety a satisfactory survey of bibliography. A selection
of good catalogues of private libraries (chiefly French) is
the best feature of the "Appendice." The distressingly
careless citations show that the compilers did not see some
of the books. This list shows some originality and is worth
reading, but it deserves no significant place in the history
of bibliographies of bibliographies.</p>

<p>Almost a generation passed after the publication of
Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i> before anyone tried again to write a
bibliography of bibliographies. [Jean] Pie Namur (1804-1867),
a librarian ("second bibliothécaire") at the University
of Liége, gave a sample of such a work in his <i>Manuel
du bibliothécaire</i> in 1834 and published his complete <i>Bibliographie
paléographico-diplomatico-bibliologique générale</i>
in 1838. Despite its many serious faults this forgotten
book deserves some recognition. Namur emphatically
disclaimed (I, p. xiv) any dependence on Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i>,
which he called a "chaos" that yielded only a few
titles. In writing his <i>Manuel</i> he had perceived that there
were no adequate bibliographies of paleography, diplomatics,
and "bibliologie" and he therefore set about compiling
them. In the section of "bibliologie" he recognized
only Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i>, Horne's <i>Introduction</i>, and Delandine's
or Psaume's list as predecessors. Although he found
them unsatisfactory, he would have left his collections unpublished
but for the urging of friends, especially Baron de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Reiffenberg, librarian of the Royal Library at Brussels (see
I, p. xx). The announcement of his plan led L.-A. Constantin,
who wrote a short handbook of library science a
few years later, to send two hundred slips and to renounce
the idea of making a bibliography of bibliographies (I,
pp. xxi-xxii).</p>

<p>We can best appreciate the not inconsiderable merits
of Namur's <i>Bibliographie</i> by squarely facing its faults. A
comprehensive bibliographical account of paleography,
diplomatics, the history of printing and the booktrade, bibliography,
the history of libraries, and literary and critical
journals is too large a task for one man or one book. I confine
my comments to a discussion of the fourth section,
which deals with bibliography.<a name="FNanchor_140_141" id="FNanchor_140_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_141" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Here as well as elsewhere
Namur's choice of a classified arrangement involves great
difficulties in arrangement. Namur's table of contents is
inadequate and he provided no subject index. In assigning
books to categories Namur fails sadly. He apologizes
in a footnote (II, 5, n. 1) for a confused alphabetical list
of 198 general bibliographies by saying that he has been
unable to see the books and therefore cannot classify them.
In this tangled heap lists of books recommended for various
kinds of specialized libraries, trade catalogues, critical
journals, Giovanni Cinelli (later Giovanni Cinelli Calvoli),
<i>Della biblioteca volante</i> (a bibliography of ephemeral publications),
G. F. DeBure's <i>Musaeum typographicum</i> (a
list of rare books),<a name="FNanchor_141_142" id="FNanchor_141_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_142" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and general bibliographies lie side by
side. Even if he had had to leave a few titles unidentified,
he had sufficient bibliographical resources within easy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>reach to bring order into this confusion. But, he should
not be judged on the basis of a list that he confessed himself
unable to classify. The following section 3, which
should have been numbered 2, is entitled "Bibliographie
des livres rares, etc." (II, 12-14). This heading gives the
reader no good idea of what to expect. Namur includes
here lists of rare books, lists of ana, John Hartley's <i>Catalogus
universalis</i> (which is described by its title), and J. B.
B. van Praet's catalogues of books printed on vellum. The
anomalous items are in all perhaps a dozen of the fifty-two
titles in this section. If we disregard the interlopers,
which could easily have been put elsewhere, this section is
a not altogether unsatisfactory account of a very important
variety of eighteenth-century bibliography. Almost all catalogues
of rare books can be readily recognized by their
titles and a critical account of them&mdash;an account which is
greatly to be desired&mdash;might begin with Namur's list. In
section 4, the bibliographies of anonyma and pseudonyma,
Namur succeeds better than in section 3. These bibliographies
are usually sufficiently identified by their titles and
mistakes should not occur. Two black sheep have, however,
found a way into the fold (II, 14, Nos. 272, 273). Books
like these with the title <i>Bibliotheca anonymiana</i> are sale
catalogues and not lists of anonymous writings. The title
corresponds to the modern "Library of a Distinguished Collector"
and Namur should have recognized it. This error
shows the dangers that a bibliographer runs in classifying
books without examining them.</p>

<p>Bibliographies of the individual languages and literatures
are ordinarily easy to recognize, but Namur makes a
few egregious mistakes in classifying them. One example
is sufficient. He puts a book on Icelandic literature correctly
in the same class with books on Danish and Swedish
literature and then enters it once more among American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
bibliographies. He introduces a further complication by
copying "Irlandiae" that a predecessor had misread for "Islandiae"
in the title of a second book by the same author
and puts it among British biobibliographies. Nor is this
enough. He cites the author's name, Hálfdan Einarsson,
as both "Hálfdanus Einar" and "Einari, H." and enters the
first under "H" and the second under "E" in the index of
authors.<a name="FNanchor_142_143" id="FNanchor_142_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_143" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> One can grant that the proper form of entry for
Icelandic names is difficult for foreigners, but a bibliographer
must learn it or at least adopt a consistent rule of
his own making. Although Namur knows directly or indirectly
many bibliographies, he has failed to find obvious
titles. A librarian at Liége who knows Anton Sander's
Flemish biobibliography should also have known his local
books of similar character for Bruges and Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_143_144" id="FNanchor_143_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_144" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Enough of this! The picture is not all black. Namur's
account of dictionaries of anonyma and pseudonyma<a name="FNanchor_144_145" id="FNanchor_144_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_145" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> contains
more titles printed before 1838 than any other bibliography.
There are some duplications but few outright errors.
His important list of books dealing with the history of
libraries and including catalogues of institutional libraries<a name="FNanchor_145_146" id="FNanchor_145_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_146" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
is the most useful one that I know. He has ranged so widely
as to cite the library catalogues of the American Philosophical
Society and the Library Company of Philadelphia and
(inaccurately) the Harvard College Library catalogue of
1790. Such titles rarely come to the knowledge of European
bibliographers. The following section (II, 167-226, Nos.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>721-2573) is an equally full review of catalogues of private
libraries. As he says in a footnote at the beginning, he has
made a special effort to attain completeness. I can cite no
list of trade catalogues and publishers' catalogues comparable
to Namur's (I, 171-193, Nos. 1283-1857). I cannot
judge competently his list of printer's type facsimiles (I,
144-146, Nos. 673-768), but its extent and the variety of
printers named is impressive. His list of national biobibliographical
dictionaries (II, 106-122, Nos. 86-390) is far
from complete, but I see in the Italian section (II, 108-110,
Nos. 129-169) several unusual titles. The subject bibliographies
seem less rich to me, but there are one hundred
and sixteen bibliographies of medicine (II, 77-83, Nos.
1457-1573) and eight bibliographies of veterinary medicine
(II, 84, Nos. 1574-1581). More examples of Namur's diligence
would be wearisome and would add nothing to the
picture. In spite of vexatious errors of all kinds Namur
often names a title not easily found elsewhere.</p>

<p>A development characteristic of nineteenth-century
bibliography consists in the publication of collectanea at
more or less regular intervals in appropriate journals. These
collectanea may be lists of recently published books and
articles, books received, or brief critical accounts of current
publications. Since they do not intend to be comprehensive,
we need not examine at length those including bibliographies.
A. G. S. Josephson mentions perhaps a score of
such periodical bibliographies of bibliographies.<a name="FNanchor_146_147" id="FNanchor_146_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_147" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Perhaps
the earliest and most influential publications of this sort
were those in the <i>Anzeiger für Literatur der Bibliothekswissenschaft</i>
(1840-1846), which was continued until 1886
by the <i>Neuer Anzeiger für Bibliographie und Bibliothekswissenschaft</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>The editor, Julius Petzholdt, used these lists
of current bibliographical publications, bibliographies of
particular subjects, and critical comments on antiquarian
catalogues in the making of his <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i>,
but those published after 1866, when the <i>Bibliotheca</i> appeared,
are not very well-known. Various other journals
devoted to bibliography, bibliophily, library science, criticism,
and the interests of publishers and dealers printed
similar collectanea. For example, a very full and carefully
compiled list of current bibliographical publications may
be found in the <i>Centralblatt für Bibliothekswesen</i>, which
was founded in 1884. These numerous lists are convenient
collections of useful materials, but I am not sure that the
makers of bibliographies of bibliographies have, with the
exception of Petzholdt, made full use of them. With the
rise of annual bibliographies of bibliographies<a name="FNanchor_147_148" id="FNanchor_147_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_148" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> that aim
at comprehensiveness their importance has somewhat declined.
I have mentioned these collectanea because they
represent a new development and are to some extent the
foundation of the book next to be discussed.</p>

<p>After the lapse of nearly three generations the <i>Bibliotheca
bibliographica</i> (1866) by Julius Petzholdt (1812-1891)
is still a standard bibliography of bibliographies. Its
position will doubtless remain unchallenged. More recent
works&mdash;notably Theodore Besterman, <i>A World Bibliography
of Bibliographies</i>&mdash;contain more titles and naturally
include those published after 1866, but Petzholdt's critical
comments and careful collations are still indispensable.
The <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> deserves its reputation for
its great merits. It also owes this reputation to some extent
to Petzholdt's position as head of the famous library at
Dresden with a long and honorable bibliographical tradition,<a name="FNanchor_148_149" id="FNanchor_148_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_149" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>his editorship of a successful journal of library science,
his standing as the author of professional handbooks,
and, last but not least, his vigorous condemnation of other
bibliographies. Petzholdt's self-assurance now and again
arouses resistance, and leads one to judge him as severely as
he judged others, but the <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> will
remain a landmark in bibliographical history.</p>

<p>Petzholdt's <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> is noteworthy
for its extent, its careful organization, its detailed collations,
and its useful critical comments. We must nevertheless
admit some qualification of all these merits. In extent,
Petzholdt falls short of his predecessor Pie Namur. Namur
had in 1838 cited 10,236 titles. Many of these did not, to
be sure, fall within the limits set by Petzholdt for his work.
A generation later Petzholdt cited only an estimated 5500
titles (I take the figure from Besterman). He achieved
this figure by excluding many old bibliographies (chiefly
works of the seventeenth century), disregarding bibliographies
published as journal articles, and including antiquarian
catalogues and a few catalogues of private libraries.
Although completeness is desirable, it is also unattainable.
A comparison in terms of numbers is not very important.</p>

<p>In the matter of organization the <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i>
has long been regarded as a model. Nevertheless
one cannot defend Petzholdt's inclusion<a name="FNanchor_149_150" id="FNanchor_149_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_150" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> of a detailed
list of schemes for classifying books. He had collected a
great deal of information about such schemes because they
interested him as a librarian, but the subject is not pertinent
to a bibliography of bibliographies. Petzholdt's relegation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>of the alphabetical index of authors to a clerk or, if
he did have a clerk, to as inaccurate a clerk as he chose,
was unfortunate. His decision to provide no alphabetical
index of subjects makes the <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> hard
to use. His exclusion of articles in journals denies the purpose
and spirit of bibliography. If bibliographical collections
are to guide seekers after knowledge to information,
then a bibliographer cannot justify the deliberate neglect
of materials which do not happen to be in a particular
physical condition. The best bibliography of the Tuamotus
may be, let us say, in a journal article. The bibliographer
who is aware of it and omits it merely because it is
a journal article is guilty of a serious fault. We can pardon
him for not finding it, but we cannot pardon him for rejecting
it. We must not confuse the situation by making
such an excuse as "avoiding the burden of inconsequential
references." Petzholdt deliberately omitted journal articles
and therefore does not serve the man who comes to his
book as fully as he might have served him. Petzholdt's inclusion
of books dealing with the invention, history, and
practice of printing stretches the definition of his purpose,
but custom is on his side and we shall not protest unduly.
Lists of books issued by a famous publisher are of course
within the scope of the <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i>.</p>

<p>A serious criticism of Petzholdt's plan concerns the inclusion
of bibliographies, which (although pertinent) can
be easily found and might have been dealt with briefly.
The bibliography of individuals "Personale Literatur," (pp.
156-272) is a branch of bibliography and must therefore
be included. Nevertheless, few bibliographies are more
easily found than lists of an author's works. The great
biobibliographical dictionaries from Conrad Gesner's <i>Bibliotheca
universalis</i> of 1545 down to the various editions of
the <i>Biographie universelle</i> and the <i>Nouvelle biographie universelle</i>
contain this information. Biographies, wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
published, ordinarily contain bibliographies of the books
written by the author in question. There are excellent indexes
of these biographies. Antoine Teissier had added,
in his <i>Catalogus</i> and <i>Auctuarium</i>, some two thousand biographies
to Labbé's <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>. E. M.
Oettinger had just published two editions of the <i>Bibliographie
bibliographique universelle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_150_151" id="FNanchor_150_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_151" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> which is still a very
convenient and full list of biographies. Any good edition
of a classical text is almost certain to contain bibliographical
information, and scarcely needs to be cited in a bibliography
of bibliographies.<a name="FNanchor_151_152" id="FNanchor_151_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_152" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> He could have written an entirely
adequate bibliography of bibliographies of individuals
in much less than a hundred and sixteen pages. He
might, for example, have omitted the bibliography of R.
Salomo b. Abraham b. Adereth (p. 166)&mdash;I cite the first
name in his list&mdash;that is found in a biography of this
worthy and the bibliography of Martial (p. 226) that is
found in an edition of his works. Such omissions would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>not have impaired his book and would have substantially
reduced its bulk.</p>

<p>This section devoted to bibliographies of individual
authors exhibits some faults typical of Petzholdt's plan. A
subdivision (pp. 156-166) without any heading begins the
section and is terminated by three asterisks in the middle
of the page. Although it is set off typographically, the lack
of a heading makes it difficult to perceive that we have in
it a list of the very important biobibliographical dictionaries
of religious orders and learned academies. There is
no indication of this category in the table of contents and
the names of the religious orders and the academies do not
appear in the index. I do not see how one can readily find
a biobibliographical dictionary of the Dominicans or the
Jesuits in this arrangement. Not all of us can bring to mind
immediately the names Quétif and De Backer that are
needed to find the references. In his list of individual bibliographies
Petzholdt goes so far as to include books (not
bibliographies, be it noticed) dealing with such artists as
Jost Ammann, Rembrandt, and Velasquez. He could have
found another place for books about famous publishers
named Aldus and should probably have made a special
place for dictionaries of homonyms.<a name="FNanchor_152_153" id="FNanchor_152_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_153" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> He follows this section
of individual bibliographies with a list of books containing
portraits ("Ikonographische Literatur," pp. 273-279).
Its pertinence to a bibliography of bibliographies
seems debatable to me.</p>

<p>Petzholdt's execution of his plan leaves something to
be desired. He provides the obviously necessary table of
contents, but fails to include in it many subdivisions that
he expresses by means of headings or typographical devices
or only implies by the arrangement of titles. Experience
teaches a reader that Petzholdt begins a section with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>general works, often a modern annual bibliography, proceeds
through a chronological list, and concludes with
specialized antiquarian catalogues. This is an altogether
logical order. Subdivisions of a large category follow the
general section. After the general bibliography of medicine,
for example, Petzholdt continues with bibliographies
of pathology and therapeutics (pp. 597-600). This arrangement
makes necessary a full record of the subdivisions in
an index, but Petzholdt's index is only an author index.
There are occasional failures to include authors' names in
the index. We must judge these flaws kindly, for all men
are fallible, and bibliographers are no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>Writers of bibliographies of bibliographies have usually
preferred a classification according to subjects to an
alphabetical arrangement of titles with subject indexes.
Joris Vorstius defends their preference eloquently and with
good arguments.<a name="FNanchor_153_154" id="FNanchor_153_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_154" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> There is, however, something to be said
against it. Convenient as a classified bibliography is as
first issued, it cannot be easily revised or enlarged.<a name="FNanchor_154_155" id="FNanchor_154_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_155" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> When
library cataloguers adopt new methods, when new categories
are set up in science, theology, law, and literary
history, a classified bibliography of bibliographies becomes
difficult to use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>In the history of bibliographies of bibliographies we
can look back to at least three occasions when men discarded
the classified bibliographies made by their predecessors.
Men of the seventeenth century seem to have
made little use of Gesner's <i>Pandectae</i>, men of the eighteenth
century found as little use for the difficult classification
employed in Labbé's and Teissier's books, and few
of us can use Petzholdt's categories easily. The lesson is
that each age must create its own bibliography of bibliographies.</p>

<p>Petzholdt's <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> is a classified
bibliography that shows signs of obsolescence. The organization
of knowledge and the categories that seemed suitable
to Julius Petzholdt in 1866 are often confusing rather
than helpful today. Keenly interested as he was in the
theory of classification, no one was more competent than
he to select the right headings. But a modern scholar who
consults the <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> must put himself in
the place of a man who lived almost a century ago. For
example, he must remember that Hungary was associated
politically with Austria and Austrian cataloguers and dealers
listed and sold Hungarian books. Consequently, Petzholdt
cites (pp. 320-321) bibliographies of Hungarian
books along with bibliographies of German books and
makes no entry in the table of contents for Hungarian bibliographies.
I do not say that he was wrong, but I do say
that a modern reader must remember the political situation
of 1866 to use Petzholdt's book.</p>

<p>Petzholdt's adoption of a classified arrangement required
him to be very careful in assigning books to categories
and to provide abundant cross-references. As we
have seen, his subdivisions of categories are not clearly
marked and may escape the notice of an experienced user
of bibliographies. For example, a bibliography of "Programme"
(learned essays issued with the annual reports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of German secondary schools) appears (p. 293) properly
enough among the bibliographies of German and Swiss
publications but few will find it. A few pages later (pp.
298-299) Petzholdt lists bibliographies of German and
Swiss journals. Since these two categories are not named
in the table of contents or the index, the information is almost
completely buried. "Prognostica" or prophecies of
future events&mdash;a genre of writings that was very popular
in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance&mdash;gave Petzholdt
trouble. Some of these are listed as pseudo-philosophy
(see p. 467: Heuschling), and others are perhaps
more appropriately found with almanacs ("Calenderliteratur,"
pp. 539-540). A bibliography of Swedish almanacs
(p. 399) appears in the section for Swedish literature without
a cross-reference to or from the bibliography of almanacs.
"Loosbücher" or books telling how to interpret omens
are in the section for psychology (p. 467), and this is a
heading under "Philosophische Litteratur." Examples are
wearisome, and I shall give no more.</p>

<p>A classified bibliography must have an exhaustive
table of contents, a full index of authors, and an adequate
alphabetical subject index. Petzholdt's <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i>
is probably as carefully made as any such book
can be made, but its table of contents is a scanty recapitulation
of the very largest headings, its index of authors is
incomplete, and a subject index is lacking. I have already
expressed sincere admiration for the book and feel all the
more keenly the presence of these defects.</p>

<p>Petzholdt's frequent disparaging remarks show that he
did not esteem highly the bibliographical achievements of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. We need not
defend them here, but we must recognize that his low
opinion of them explains many omissions of early bibliographies
in his own work. His admirable survey of books
that a scholar would find useful in 1866 gives no adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
account of the historical development of bibliography or
of the wealth of bibliographical work before 1750. His
very convenient chronological arrangement of titles in the
various categories does often suggest the historical development
and at times his choice of older books is generous.</p>

<p>Petzholdt has not compared his accounts of some
fields with easily available bibliographies and therefore
fails to include obviously important books. In the field of
national bibliographies, Petzholdt chose to pass over many
older bibliographies that seemed to him to be no longer
useful. Both the Latin and the German editions of Heinrich
Pantaleon's rare sixteenth-century German biobibliography
could perhaps be dispensed with, and I shall not
object to his omission of them.<a name="FNanchor_155_156" id="FNanchor_155_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_156" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> I think he should not
have passed over without mention Henning Witte's biobibliographical
dictionaries, which are still useful sources
of information about obscure seventeenth century writers.
To be sure, Witte's <i>Repertorium biblicum</i> is cited (p. 286),
but this is the least useful of Witte's books. Petzholdt's
account of German regional biobibliographies (pp. 299-322)
can only be called superficial. In Robert F. Arnold,
<i>Allgemeine Bücherkunde zur neueren deutschen Literaturgeschichte</i>,<a name="FNanchor_156_157" id="FNanchor_156_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_157" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
which I have compared only for the first
page (the entries extending from Aargau through Bayern),
I find twelve books published before 1866 that Petzholdt
does not name. If we turn to works of larger scope, one
cannot easily find a reason for omitting D'Herbelot, <i>Bibliothèque
orientale</i>. First published in 1697, improved and
enlarged in later editions, and brought up to date by J.
T. Zenker's continuation of 1846-1861, it remains the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>general account of Oriental studies for its period. Petzholdt
neglects to mention the seventeenth-century biobibliographies
of Italian and French Orientalists compiled
by Paul Colomies and deemed worthy of revision by no
less a scholar than J. C. Wolf. With all its faults Namur's
<i>Bibliographie</i> could have helped Petzholdt to fill such gaps.</p>

<p>Petzholdt lavishes labor and space on antiquarian
catalogues. He cites them in closely printed pages in
double columns at the end of every major subject division
and obviously intends the reader to regard them as subject
bibliographies. Some antiquarian catalogues are very valuable
and others are worthless for this purpose. We have
no adequate appraisal of them except these lists by Petzholdt
and for this reason he deserves high praise. In fields
where no good bibliography is available we are glad to
use these catalogues, even though the books have been
dispersed. When institutions have purchased the collections
<i>en bloc</i>, the catalogues have a special importance because
the books can still be found with little difficulty.
Kuczynski and Knaake are such well-known guides to
the poorly-recorded books of the Reformation that they
are ordinarily cited simply by the authors' names.<a name="FNanchor_157_158" id="FNanchor_157_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_158" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The sale
catalogues of the libraries of K. W. L. Heyse, K. H. G.
Meusebach, and Viktor Manheimer are indispensable aids
in the almost uncharted sea of German seventeenth-century
literature.<a name="FNanchor_158_159" id="FNanchor_158_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_159" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Bibliographers and bibliophiles use antiquarian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>and sale catalogues in tracing the history of particular
copies of famous rarities.<a name="FNanchor_159_160" id="FNanchor_159_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_160" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> A student of the Dance
of Death consults the Susan Minns catalogue,<a name="FNanchor_160_161" id="FNanchor_160_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_161" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and Mario
Praz compiled a bibliography of emblem books almost
exclusively from antiquarian catalogues and catalogues of
private libraries.<a name="FNanchor_161_162" id="FNanchor_161_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_162" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Indispensable, then, as these catalogues
often are, the compiler of a list should be alert to reject
those of little value. Petzholdt should not have devoted
seven pages (pp. 691-696) to antiquarian catalogues of
classical Latin and Greek authors. Excellent bibliographies
were available and a highly selective list of catalogues
would have been sufficient. He could surely have
omitted a catalogue (p. 696) of twenty pages issued by
E. Weingart in 1864 that contains chiefly ordinary German
books. The choice of catalogues for permanent record
in a bibliography of bibliographies calls for the judgment
and experience that Petzholdt had and did not use.</p>

<p>The list of catalogues (pp. 98-101) appended to the
general bibliographies is perhaps the most unfortunate
exhibit of Petzholdt's selections. His wide experience in
this field should have told him the right catalogues to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>cite. He offers us a strange hodgepodge consisting of one
early eighteenth-century catalogue (the <i>Duboisiana</i>), a
handbook of bibliography, several nineteenth-century catalogues
of private libraries, and a few dealers' catalogues.
The <i>Duboisiana</i>, Michael Denis's <i>Einleitung in die Bücherkunde</i>,
and Part II of the Libri catalogue (1861) are not
hard to justify, but the remaining titles appear to be a
random selection. Inasmuch as he devotes almost one
quarter of the space to a full-length citation of a part
of the Libri catalogue, he should have taken the trouble
to find the other parts. Although Petzholdt's list of catalogues
interesting to bibliographers has the merit of being
more international in scope than most of his lists for
special disciplines, he overlooked many large and admirable
polymathic catalogues. He does not mention the
Thott and Heber catalogues or the <i>Firmiana</i>, to name
no others.</p>

<p>Petzholdt's abundant descriptive and critical comments
ensure the <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> of a permanent
place on every bibliographer's desk. He expresses an
extensive analysis and usually accurate opinion about
almost every book that he cites. It did not occur to him
to tell the reader the number of titles in these books, but
bibliographers have been slow to realize the value of
this detail.</p>

<p>There are, however, some qualifications of any praise
of Petzholdt's comments. His unsympathetic feeling for
sixteenth- and seventeenth-century bibliographers leads
him to dismiss (p. 7) Teissier's bibliographies of bibliographies
with "Virtually worthless today (Gegenwärtig so
gut wie werthlos)." His condemnation of Raffaelle Soprani's
Genoese biobibliography (pp. 360-361) and Leo Allacci's
<i>Apes Urbanae</i> (p. 362) for listing authors by their
first names can be properly called naive. In describing
Agostino Oldoini's similar book for Perugia (p. 363), he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
says that this was the usual procedure in the seventeenth
century and involved only the inconvenience of consulting
an index of last names. These Renaissance bibliographers
had inherited this procedure from medieval scholars who
knew men by their Christian names and used other designations
only when a differentiation of individuals was
necessary. Even today a bibliography arranged in this
fashion can prove to be a useful tool. The medieval mathematician
Richard Suisset, whose last name occurs in various
spellings, can be easily tracked down by use of his Christian
name. He is not easy to find in a modern book unless one
remembers the particular spelling of his name that the
author prefers.</p>

<p>Petzholdt passes some very severe judgments on some
books that were once highly esteemed and on some that are
unique surveys of a particular field. Whatever defects
such books may have, they should not be damned hastily
and completely. For example, Petzholdt's rejection (p.
160) of Johannes Tritheim's catalogue of Carmelite writers
as "bibliographically completely worthless (Bibliographisch
ganz ohne Werth)" is far too harsh. In 1576, after it had
circulated in manuscript for almost a century, the Carmelites
believed it deserved to be printed. Three more editions
(1596, 1624, and 1643), all of which Petzholdt cites,
came out during the next seventy years. Men obviously
found it useful, and it is the basis of the modern Carmelite
bibliography. The remark "Of altogether inferior bibliographical
value (Bibliographisch von ganz untergeordnetem
Werthe)" is even more unjust to Theodore Petreius's Carthusian
bibliography (p. 161). However bad it may be,
Petzholdt knew no other Carthusian bibliography. The
only bibliography of a field may be incomplete, inaccurate,
or badly arranged and it may even have all these defects,
but it cannot be altogether worthless. Paul Lehmann, a
competent authority in medieval bibliography and literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
history, mentions Petreius and some other early writers of
biobibliographies of religious orders and says that scarcely
one of these writers has been superseded, although details
in their work may need correction.<a name="FNanchor_162_163" id="FNanchor_162_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_163" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Petzholdt's critical remarks on bibliographies written
in the second half of the eighteenth and the first half of
the nineteenth century are very full and informative. Rarely
does he err as badly as he does in a comment on Emil
Weller's <i>Annalen</i>. This partial revision of G. W. Panzer,
<i>Annalen der deutschen National-Literatur</i> (1792-1805) is,
like the original work, still valuable for German publications
between 1500 and 1525. Weller's notes on books that
he had seen contain no great number of serious mistakes.
Nevertheless, Petzholdt says (p. 708): "A book that deserves
very much to be noticed, although it by no means
lacks bibliographical defects and [shows] hastiness and
carelessness. It owes its great value to the wealth of the
collections that the compiler was able to use." Weller was
as difficult in his manners as Magliabecchi, Fontanini, and
other bibliographers have been on occasion and had spoken
unkindly of Petzholdt, but he did not deserve such a patronizing
slur.</p>

<p>Petzholdt's self-assurance carries him to the length of
condemning books that he has not seen. Of a <i>Catalogo di
commedie italiane</i> published in 1776 he says: "It is said to
be an extremely rare pamphlet that contains all the Italian
comedies arranged in alphabetical order according to the
authors' names. The rarity of the pamphlet seems to be
greater than its bibliographical value."<a name="FNanchor_163_164" id="FNanchor_163_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_164" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> As he indicates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>by an asterisk, he has not seen the <i>Catalogo</i>. Any complete
or relatively complete account of Italian comedies is obviously
a useful book.</p>

<p>All that I have said in qualification of Petzholdt's merits
does not diminish my admiration for him and his book.
The <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> deserves a close and critical
reading and only a great book survives such study. It is a
masterpiece of modern bibliography.</p>

<p>I turn now to a smaller book by another famous bibliographer.
It is one of his minor efforts and will not detain
us long. Joseph Sabin (1821-1881), a bibliographer of
Americana, found John Power's little <i>Handy-Book about
Books</i> (London, 1870) very unsatisfactory. Although Power
intended only to offer a brief selective list of books useful
to a bibliographer or bibliophile, Sabin rejected it and
wrote a much larger list. He entitled it <i>Bibliography of
Bibliography, or a handy book about books which relate
to books, being an alphabetical catalogue of the most important
works descriptive of the literature of Great Britain
and America, and more than a few relative to France and
Germany</i> (1877). It names perhaps twelve hundred titles
and includes a few bibliographies printed as parts of non-bibliographical
works and a few journal articles. The
word "literature" in the title means publications in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
field of learning and not merely belles lettres. Since Sabin
provides neither a table of contents (his strictly alphabetical
arrangement did not call for one) nor a subject index,
one must read his book from cover to cover to find what it
contains or to discover a particular subject bibliography.
His occasional brief critical comments are often drawn
from Petzholdt. As his subtitle indicates, he has included
many books that are not bibliographies. Some he has carried
over from Power's list that he has included in its entirety,
although with misgivings, and some he has added
on his own responsibility. Beloe's <i>Anecdotes of Literature
and Scarce Books</i> contains much bibliographical information,
but can hardly be called a bibliography. Bonnardot's
treatises on repairing bindings, Botford's and Clarke's books
about libraries, and Constantin's treatise on library economy
are books about books in the modern sense of the term.
Like most writers of a bibliography of bibliographies, Sabin
includes works dealing with the history of printing.</p>

<p>In his title Sabin announces an intention of naming
chiefly bibliographies written by British and American
scholars or dealing with British and American subjects.
Since he was an agent and bookdealer specializing in Americana
and the author of a bibliography in that field, his
account of bibliographies of Americana is naturally adequate.
It begins with Bishop White Kennett's <i>Bibliothecae
Americanae Primordia</i> (1713) and extends through later
standard works down to the antiquarian catalogues of such
dealers as Frederik Muller, Otto Rich, and Henry Stevens
in Sabin's own day. His selection of strictly British bibliographies
is more cursory. Although he had Petzholdt's description
before him, he reports John Bale's sixteenth century
biobibliographies inaccurately. He passes over John
Pits's Renaissance account of British authors without mention.
Thomas Tanner's <i>Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica</i>,
which was still a very valuable reference work when Sabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was writing, either was so rare that it escaped his notice or
seemed, although wrongly, to have been replaced. Sabin
is obviously not much interested in British biobibliographies.
His account of bibliographies in special fields is
fairly satisfactory. He gives many useful references to
British and American catalogues of private libraries, and
his comments on them are often helpful. His arrangement
of these titles is extremely clumsy. I cite the catchwords
under which Sabin lists a few of these catalogues: Askew,
Bibliotheca Heberiana (he neglects to mention the thirteenth
part), Bibliotheca Smithiana, Catalogue of Books
... in the Collection of Colonel Joseph Aspinwall, and
Crevenna. These are references now to the collector's
name and now to the first word in the title. <i>The Catalogue
of the Valuable Library of Stanesby Alchorne, Esq.</i> is under
the compiler's name, T. F. Dibdin. There are no cross-references
and the arrangement is confusing. Sabin's interest
in T. F. Dibdin led him to cite an autobiography, a
book that cannot be called a bibliography.</p>

<p>Sabin promises to give "more than a few" bibliographies
relative to France and Germany, but does not make
clear how he chooses them. He passes over Johannes Tritheim
and Conrad Gesner without mention and seems to
know little about other sixteenth- and seventeenth-century
bibliographies. His wide acquaintance with Americana
leads him to mention Antonio León Pinelo's <i>Epitome</i> of
1620, perhaps the first important bibliography of Americana.
On the whole, his choice of eighteenth century bibliographies
is judicious. He cites the encyclopedic Georgi
and such standard catalogues of rare books as Clement and
Freytag, although he does not know the last and largest
edition of Johannes Vogt, <i>Catalogus librorum rariorum</i>. He
makes a good selection of eighteenth-century subject bibliographies,
which were for the most part still valuable reference
works in the 1870's. History is sufficiently represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
by Lenglet du Fresnoy and Meusel's edition of
Struve. Cave, Du Pin, and Walch are the right books to
recommend to a theologian. As far as he goes, Sabin is
generally successful in naming histories, which are virtually
bibliographies, of national literatures, but J. A. Fabricius,
<i>Bibliotheca mediae et infimae latinitatis</i> and J. C. Wolf,
<i>Bibliotheca hebraea</i> are lacking. He mentions only a few
regional biobibliographies and seems to have had no plan
in selecting them. I have examined only his references to
Italian examples of this genre, but these are well-known
and easily found. In other fields than history and literature
he has usually chosen wisely. He knows Pritzel's botanical
bibliography and Van der Linden's medical bibliography.
He has a blind eye for bibliographies of the religious
orders. As we might expect, De Backer's Jesuit
bibliography is present, but it is surprising to see no mention
of Wadding's account of the Franciscans, who had a
large share in the cultural development of the Spanish
colonies in America, or Quétif and Echard's biobibliographical
dictionary of the Dominicans. In brief, Sabin's book is
probably as good a book as can be written in one hundred
and fifty pages. A classified and an alphabetical index of
subjects would have vastly increased its usefulness. Had
he made them, he would have perceived and filled the
gaps.</p>

<p>Sabin's purpose in writing <i>A Bibliography of Bibliographies</i>
remains somewhat mysterious. I cannot understand
how he failed to see the necessity of making
indexes. How, for example, is the user to discover the
bibliographies of precocious children, mnemonics, and
chess in F. Cancellieri, <i>Dissertazione intorno agli uomini
dotati ad</i> [read <i>ed</i>] <i>a quelli divenuti smemorati, colle biblioteche
degli scrittori sopra gli eruditi precoci, la memoria
artificiale ed il giuoco degli scacchi</i> (pp. xxviii-xxix) without
a subject index? We can commend Sabin for enlarging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Power's dilettante list into a reference work. We can
commend his care in citing books and his industry and
judgment in choosing them, but accuracy, industry, and
learning are not the only virtues required of a bibliographer.
A bibliographer must be a practical man who
sees how his book will be used.</p>

<p>Sabin's book has remained almost unknown, but the
next book to be discussed has an unenviable reputation.
No one has a kind word for Léon Vallée, <i>Bibliographie
des bibliographies</i> (1883-1887), but in damning it few have
effectively supported their opinions. It is not a good book,
but it has perhaps been judged too severely. As an example
of a sweeping and unsupported condemnation I cite
what A. G. S. Josephson wrote in 1901:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This work is of comparatively slight value in spite of the vast
material that it contains. It is very uncritical and gives in most
cases no hint as to the whereabouts of bibliographical materials
in the books referred to. The alphabetical arrangement by
authors, even with the subject index, makes the work difficult
to consult. [It may] be a useful basis for a more scholarly work.<a name="FNanchor_164_165" id="FNanchor_164_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_165" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not only Josephson's judgment but also the
judgment that bibliographers have generally passed on
Vallée. Reviewers contemporary with Vallée are perhaps
somewhat more favorable in their estimates, but make
their dissatisfaction altogether plain. In an article suggested
by Josephson's bibliography in which this criticism
appears, Vilhelm Grundtvig expressed an equally condemnatory
opinion about Vallée's book.<a name="FNanchor_165_166" id="FNanchor_165_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_166" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> He declares that
only Petzholdt's <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> and Henri
Stein's <i>Manuel</i> (which is yet to be mentioned) deserve
mention among bibliographies of bibliographies. This
means passing over Labbé, Teissier, and Peignot, who
were very respectable workers indeed. He goes on to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>say that Vallée's book does not even deserve review and
is altogether unworthy of a member of the staff of the
greatest library in the world. Theodore Besterman's judgment
(I, p. x) is equally severe:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is difficult to say much in praise of this compilation, which
has, indeed, been universally condemned. Its general plan is
basically wrong, and it contains far too many irrelevancies, mistakes,
omissions, and second-hand descriptions. To indicate the
general standard of accuracy maintained by Vallée, it is perhaps
enough to say that, although a large part of his volume was
taken bodily from Petzholdt, that scholar's name is spelt incorrectly
throughout the entries under his name.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vallée's book is unsatisfactory, but I cannot listen to
this chorus without examining the criticisms briefly.
Josephson's damning notice signifies very little. As far as
such rough tests as I have used can show, Vallée does
not include an unreasonable proportion of unsuitable titles.
I have examined the first entry on page 25, and each
succeeding twenty-fifth page without finding an instance
of a non-bibliographical title. If Josephson means that
Vallée gives many unnecessary references, I should agree
with him. Vallée should not choose to cite Thomas Stapleton's
biography of Sir Thomas More (p. 519, No. 6048)
because it contains bibliographical information or to give
hundreds of similar references. I cannot however agree
with Josephson's remark that Vallée fails to indicate where
this bibliographical information appears in the books
cited. It seems altogether unnecessary to cite a bibliography
found in a biography, an edition of a classical Latin
or Greek author, or a general treatise on some subject,
but when Vallée cites it, as he does in imitation of Petzholdt
with distressing frequency, he ordinarily gives reference
to pages. I cannot see that an alphabetical arrangement
according to authors with a subject index is very
much more difficult to use than an alphabetical or
classified arrangement according to subjects with an author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
index, but in this opinion I stand alone against general
bibliographical practice and shall say no more here. In
any event, Vallée's choice of arrangement seems a comparatively
minor fault, when compared with Petzholdt's
and Stein's choice of a classified arrangement with altogether
unsatisfactory subject indexes and hastily-made
author indexes. I speak in Vallée's behalf partly because
of Josephson's arrangement of a bibliography to be mentioned
at the end of this essay. Josephson chose to arrange
the titles in chronological order without providing either
an author or a subject index. No one has ever recommended
such an arrangement.</p>

<p>I shall let Vallée's book speak for itself. Like the
bibliographers who immediately preceded and followed
him, Vallée struck out for himself and gave little heed
to earlier work. This appears even in his references to
bibliographers of bibliographies. In an "Avertissement" he
recognizes only three predecessors: Tonnelli in 1782,
Petzholdt in 1866, and Sabin in 1872 [the date is wrong].
This is a bad start. Francesco Tonnelli's book<a name="FNanchor_166_167" id="FNanchor_166_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_167" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> is a worthless
mixture of a biobibliographical dictionary and a bibliographical
handbook. The biobibliographical information
is a disorderly collection of notes, referring chiefly, but
by no means exclusively, to men whose names begin with
the first letters of the alphabet. The bibliographical information
is a miscellany of facts about libraries. Tonnelli,
who has occasionally buried bibliographies in this
rubbish heap, had no intention of writing a bibliography
of bibliographies. I cannot guess what use Vallée made of
Tonnelli's queer book. If he actually consulted it, he
should have objected to its disorderliness and its lack of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>materials for his needs. Petzholdt's book is, as Vallée
says, a classified bibliography of bibliographies made by
a competent scholar. It is regrettable that he did not
fully accept it as his model. He gives the wrong date for
Sabin's book, which began to appear serially in 1875 and
was published in 1877. He does not make it clear that
he has seen and used it.</p>

<p>If we turn to Vallée's references to the works mentioned
in this essay, we find nothing to encourage us. He
puts Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i>, Teissier's edition of Labbé's
<i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>, and Labbé's first edition in
the <i>Novae bibliothecae specimen</i><a name="FNanchor_167_168" id="FNanchor_167_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_168" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> of 1653 in a section
entitled "Bibliographies générales." In other words, he
does not consider them to be bibliographies of bibliographies.
I cannot see that he cites Labbé's <i>Bibliotheca
bibliothecarum</i> at all. Namur's <i>Bibliographie</i> is in a section
entitled "Bibliologie" (p. 621) with a mistake in its
title. All this indicates, I am afraid, that Vallée did not
recognize a bibliography of bibliographies when he saw
it. This grievous fault is all the more grievous because
he emphasizes in his preface the importance of careful
classification.</p>

<p>Vallée is guilty of many more faults. He includes titles
that do not belong in a bibliography of bibliographies.<a name="FNanchor_168_169" id="FNanchor_168_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_169" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
As I have already said, their number does not seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>me to be very large and many of them lie on the fringes
of bibliography. His descriptions and entries are incomplete
and inaccurate.<a name="FNanchor_169_170" id="FNanchor_169_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_170" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> He cites bibliographies that can
be easily found and scarcely need mention.<a name="FNanchor_170_171" id="FNanchor_170_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_171" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> He fails to
analyze the long subject entries in his index.<a name="FNanchor_171_172" id="FNanchor_171_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_172" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> He makes
serious errors in names, dates, titles, and places of publications
and is careless about editions and the continuations
of works that spread over several years. In his
supplement of 1887, he fails to repair the faults that reviewers
had pointed out. More serious than anything in
this long list of faults is, in my opinion, his rash attempt
to survey all bibliographies anew with little or no regard
for his predecessors.</p>

<p>Two things must be said in reduction of this severe
judgment on Vallée. He is the first compiler of a bibliography
of bibliographies to base his work on the books
in a particular library and to indicate, although incompletely
and inaccurately, what he has seen there. He has
included many references to bibliographical sections in
non-bibliographical books. Although these and other references
of slight value are numerous, he has accumulated
a very large number of bibliographies. Almost everyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>will find something useful in Vallée's book. The first
volume contains 6894 titles, and the supplement raises
the total to 10,246. In a savage criticism<a name="FNanchor_172_173" id="FNanchor_172_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_173" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Henri Stein
declared that perhaps 2500 titles should have been omitted
and 3000 should be added. This amounts to saying that
Vallée collected about three-quarters of the bibliographies
he should have found. I cannot vouch for the correctness
of these estimates but they may suggest what the book
is worth. It is regrettable that Henri Stein, to whom we
now turn, did not give the additional titles as a supplement
instead of writing a new bibliography of bibliographies.</p>

<p>In the <i>Manuel de bibliographie générale</i> (1897) Henri
Stein (b. 1862), a member of the staff of the Bibliothèque
Nationale, offered the world a new bibliography of bibliographies.
He calls it nothing less than a summary of
all bibliographies published before 1897,<a name="FNanchor_173_174" id="FNanchor_173_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_174" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> but seems at
times to be content to supplement Petzholdt's <i>Bibliotheca
bibliographica</i>. He falls far short of completeness and
does not make his intention entirely clear. Although the
task that he undertook is beyond any man's strength, his
treatment of his colleague Vallée does not awaken sympathy
for him.</p>

<p>Stein yields to the same temptation to which his
predecessors had succumbed. He includes material of
little pertinence to a bibliography of bibliographies. For
example, he could have omitted a long list (pp. 555-636)
of places where books were printed before 1800 and the
names of the printers. This information is very useful to
a historian of printing, but has no proper place in Stein's
book. His list of indexes to journals is useful but is also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>not altogether pertinent.<a name="FNanchor_174_175" id="FNanchor_174_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_175" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> His long list of printed catalogues
of public libraries, a list which is limited almost
exclusively to rather recent publications, is something of
a luxury.<a name="FNanchor_175_176" id="FNanchor_175_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_176" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Neither logic nor custom justifies an objection
to the inclusion of bibliographies of individual authors,
but Stein could have reduced their number without loss.<a name="FNanchor_176_177" id="FNanchor_176_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_177" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>Stein based his classification on Petzholdt's book but
introduced modifications of his own. As Vilhelm Grundtvig
correctly says, the classification is "at times nothing
less than amazing, for example, hippology is under 'sciences
pédagogiques' [and] dentistry under 'medicine interne.'"<a name="FNanchor_177_178" id="FNanchor_177_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_178" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
Although he provides a table of contents and
an alphabetical subject index, he has not made his book
easy to use. There is no index of authors' names.</p>

<p>The <i>Manuel</i> does not contain all the available bibliographies
or even a satisfactory collection of the best ones.
Stein's surveys of universal and national bibliographies
are inadequate and so, too, are the sections dealing with
philosophy, chemistry, education, sport, and linguistics.<a name="FNanchor_178_179" id="FNanchor_178_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_179" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
He shows very little interest in bibliographies printed before
1800. He does not carry out systematically or successfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>an announced intention of expressing critical
judgments.<a name="FNanchor_179_180" id="FNanchor_179_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_180" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
Finally, he is inaccurate in details.<a name="FNanchor_180_181" id="FNanchor_180_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_181" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>This recital seems to leave little to be said in Stein's
favor, but no bibliographer who has made a serious effort
to write a useful book has ever failed to be helpful. Any
list of 5500 bibliographies&mdash;the figure is Besterman's&mdash;will
contain titles and information worth noting and remembering.
He calls attention to books that other men
have not seen or have neglected to cite. For example, I
have not seen "Ahm. Zeki-Bey, <i>Elmevsonat</i> (Boulak, 1904),"
which he describes (p. 264) as a bibliography of Arabic
encyclopedias, mentioned elsewhere. We owe to him the
interesting and important fact that the unpublished manuscript
of Mazzuchelli's enormous work, <i>Gli scrittori d'Italia</i>,
is in the Vatican Library.<a name="FNanchor_181_182" id="FNanchor_181_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_182" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> He adds many titles to those
cited by Petzholdt and Vallée. I lay aside the <i>Manuel</i> with
the regret that Stein's zeal has given us a less useful book
than we might have hoped for. Had he named, as I have
suggested, the three thousand bibliographies lacking in
Vallée and had he continued the collection from Vallée's
supplement of 1887 to his own publication in 1897, he
would have given us an invaluable book. What we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>is one more demonstration of the unwillingness of bibliographers
in his century to join hands with their predecessors
and contemporaries.</p>

<small>Bibliographies of Bibliographies as
Periodical and Cooperative Enterprises</small></h2>


<p>In the historical development of bibliographies of bibliographies
two aspects become especially prominent after
1900. Periodical surveys become a characteristic form of
publication and cooperation in the making of bibliographies
becomes more frequent or is at least more frequently
called for. I shall speak only briefly about periodical
publications because they aim at completeness, if they
make such an effort at all, only for annual or other limited
periods of time. Julius Petzholdt published lists of bibliographies
that came to his attention around the middle of
the nineteenth century in the <i>Neuer Anzeiger für Bibliographie
und Bibliothekswissenschaft</i>. Editors of other
journals for bibliography, library science, the book trade,
and related fields have published similar lists and have in
some instances endeavored more or less successfully to convert
them into surveys of current bibliographies of current
bibliographical publications. A rapid growth of periodical
bibliographies of special fields is characteristic of nineteenth-century
scholarship. At the end of the century
bibliographers advanced to the stage of compiling annual
bibliographies of bibliographies. Such periodical surveys
had long been established in fields like theology and classical
literature and were now somewhat tardily created
for bibliography itself.</p>

<p>The first annual survey of current bibliographical publications
seems to be the <i>Bibliographia bibliographica</i>,
which appeared in six volumes between 1898 and 1903.
Librarians inspired and guided this cooperative enterprise.
The list, which includes bibliographies published in non-bibliographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
works, is arranged according to the decimal
system of classification and was no doubt handicapped
by this fact. Since the editors offer a brief outline of the
decimal classification in place of a table of contents and
provide no alphabetical index of subjects, the <i>Bibliographia
bibliographica</i> is not easy to use. The lack of an author
index was remedied by the publication of an index for the
first two volumes that appeared at the end of the second
volume. The <i>Bibliographia bibliographica</i> aroused very
little interest among librarians and bibliographers. I have
found no reviews of it in the contemporary journals for
bibliography and library science. Harvard University Library
purchased only the first two issues and these were so
little used that, after the lapse of fifty years, they are still
unbound.</p>

<p>A second annual survey of the current output of bibliographies
is the <i>Bibliographie des Bibliotheks- und Buchwesens</i>,
edited by Adalbert Hortzschansky from 1905 to
1925 with an interruption of eight years from 1913 to 1921.
This supplement to the <i>Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen</i>
had a longer and more successful life than its predecessor.
It surveyed all publications that fell within the field of the
journal and therefore included much more than the bibliography
of bibliographies. In 1926 it became an independent
publication with a slightly different title but with no
change in the subjects reported upon. This <i>Internationale
Bibliographie des Buch- und Bibliothekswesens</i> continued
to be issued down to the outbreak of war in 1939. An enterprise
of somewhat similar scope, the <i>Literarisches Beiblatt
der Zeitschrift</i> (later: <i>zum Jahrbuch</i>) <i>des deutschen
Vereins für Buchwesen und Schrifttum</i> began to appear in
1924 and continued to 1939. Since these annual surveys
include more than the bibliography of bibliographies, I
shall not discuss them further.</p>

<p>Three reviews of contemporary bibliographical work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
have appeared during the last twenty-five years. One of
them is limited to bibliographies of a particular kind, and
the other two are more or less complete periodical surveys
of bibliographical writings. I mention them here as the last
examples of the development of periodical bibliographies
of bibliographies and as a means by which one can estimate
the task of any modern compiler of a bibliography of bibliographies.
The first of these, the <i>Index bibliographicus</i>,
which first appeared in 1925, offers an interesting example
of specialization within the field of bibliographies of bibliographies.
The <i>Index bibliographicus</i> is general in scope
but cites only bibliographies of bibliographies that appear
as current serial publications. In the six years between its
first appearance in 1925 and its republication in enlarged
and improved form in 1931 the number of currently appearing
serial bibliographies rose from 1025 to 1900. Some
of these had been overlooked in 1925, but many of the additions
concerned bibliographies of bibliographies that had
been established during the six years between the two editions.
The <i>Index bibliographicus</i>, which was compiled with
the assistance of the League of Nations, assumed a more
definitely international and cooperative aspect when Joris
Vorstius joined Marcel Godet as editor.<a name="FNanchor_182_183" id="FNanchor_182_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_183" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> A third edition
of the <i>Index</i> made by Theodore Besterman in 1952 is still
larger than either of its predecessors.</p>

<p>The <i>Internationaler Jahresbericht der Bibliographie</i>,
which flourished from 1930 to 1940 under the editorship of
Joris Vorstius, enables us to survey quickly the current annual
production of bibliographies. Critical comments attached
to the titles make it one of the most readable bibliographies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>of bibliographies. Like caviar, the genre is digestible
only by those who have acquired a taste for it. The
organization of the <i>Internationaler Jahresbericht</i> is skillful,
and the comments are judicious and instructive. Since
Vorstius was editor of the previously mentioned <i>Internationale
Bibliographie des Buch- und Bibliothekswesens</i> as
well as the <i>Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen</i>, he saw a very
large number of bibliographies. He was compelled to hold
very carefully to the definitions of his closely related and
very similar tasks. The <i>Internationaler Jahresbericht</i> of
course lists only bibliographies.</p>

<p>The H. W. Wilson Co. has published the most comprehensive
of all periodical surveys of bibliography. Starting
in 1938, the quarterly issues are cumulated in annual
volumes and these are, in turn, cumulated in volumes for
periods of variable length. A cumulation of the bibliographies
published in the years between 1937 and 1942 appeared
in 1945, and a second cumulation for the years 1943-1946
appeared in 1948. This is the first virtually complete
account of current bibliographical production, and the picture
is amazing. Between 1937 and 1942 some fifty thousand
bibliographies were published. The editors of the <i>Bibliographic
Index</i> have classified them in almost ten thousand
categories.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion of these annual or otherwise
chronologically limited surveys of bibliography is incidental
to the main historical purpose of this essay. Such surveys
illustrate very effectively an emphasis which has become
characteristic of much modern bibliographical work,
and especially of bibliographies of bibliographies, since Gabriel
Peignot's book of 1812. Being concerned solely with
the current production of bibliographies, they have obviously
had no occasion to deal historically with bibliographies
or to cite bibliographies published before the limits
that they set for themselves. This emphasis on currently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
useful bibliographical tools goes hand in hand with the
cooperative aspect of making bibliographies that I shall
stress in this chapter. Already in his <i>Répertoire</i> of 1812
Gabriel Peignot had reviewed eighteenth-century bibliography
with occasional citations of earlier works that had
not been superseded. In 1866 Julius Petzholdt had dealt
somewhat more generously than Peignot with Renaissance
and seventeenth-century bibliographies, but had scarcely
included enough of them to give a picture satisfactory to a
historian. Like these predecessors, Joseph Sabin, Léon Vallée,
and Henri Stein had shown a marked preference for
contemporary works. The uses which bibliographies of
bibliographies ordinarily serve explain this preference and
make it a reasonable one.</p>

<p>The history of mass-production methods in the making
of bibliographies has not yet been written. I conjecture
that it begins with bibliographies produced more than a
century ago by the German publisher Wilhelm Engelmann.
His firm continued and revised some bibliographies established
by Johann Samuel Ersch (1766-1828), whose scholarly
and bibliographical activity began in the eighteenth
century. It is not entirely clear whether Ersch himself had
already adopted something like mass-production methods.
However this may be, the titles and the nature of many bibliographies
produced by T. C. F. Enslin (1787-1851) and
Wilhelm Engelmann (1808-1878), who made new editions
of some of Enslin's bibliographies as well as many of his
own, virtually imply such methods. Information about the
making of these bibliographies and those of F. A. Wilhelm
Müldener (1830-1900), who seems to have worked in the
same way, is difficult to obtain.<a name="FNanchor_183_184" id="FNanchor_183_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_184" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The compilation and publication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>of bibliographies by printers and publishers rather
than scholars has been continued by such American firms
as the Library Bureau (now no longer in existence), R. R.
Bowker &amp; Co., and H. W. Wilson Co. These firms have
actively supported the making of bibliographies in this
country for more than two generations.<a name="FNanchor_184_185" id="FNanchor_184_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_185" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>An admirable essay, <i>Some Aspects of Bibliography</i>
(1900), by John Ferguson (d. 1916) suggests the cooperative
aspect that is characteristic of bibliographical studies
in the last two generations. Although it is not a full-length
bibliography of bibliographies, it reviews the kinds of bibliographies
that have been made and appeals to scholars to
compile the bibliographies necessary to satisfy the most
obvious needs. Ferguson's modest list of some four hundred
bibliographies is intended to serve two purposes. It
is an effort to show the great variety of bibliographies that
have been made and it offers a supplement to Petzholdt's
<i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i>. Ferguson's clear and very instructive
classification of bibliographies is as follows: bibliographies
according to (1) date; (2) place; (3) printer;
(4) material;<a name="FNanchor_185_186" id="FNanchor_185_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_186" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
(5) type;<a name="FNanchor_186_187" id="FNanchor_186_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_187" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
(6) size;<a name="FNanchor_187_188" id="FNanchor_187_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_188" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> (7) illustrations; (8)
language; (9) subject; (10) groups of authors;<a name="FNanchor_188_189" id="FNanchor_188_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_189" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
(11) individuals;
(12) single books;<a name="FNanchor_189_190" id="FNanchor_189_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_190" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
(13) anonymous books;<a name="FNanchor_190_191" id="FNanchor_190_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_191" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>(14) suppressed
books;<a name="FNanchor_191_192" id="FNanchor_191_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_192" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> (15) rare books; (16) general
bibliographies.</p>

<p>Some categories of bibliographies might be added to
this list. For example, he probably includes bibliographies
of private presses in (3). He has no good place for bibliographies
of translations, which do not fit easily in the
ninth category of bibliographies according to subjects. Nor
is there a convenient place for bibliographies of belles lettres
according to genres like the novel, the essay, or the
book review.</p>

<p>The first bibliography of bibliographies published in
the twentieth century is <i>A Register of National Bibliography
with a selection of the chief bibliographical books
and articles printed in other countries</i> (3 v., 1905-1912) by
W. P. Courtney (1845-1913). It is also the first effort of
this sort to be made by an Englishman. Like the American
Sabin, Courtney limits the bibliographies published in
languages other than English to a selection. In the course
of twenty years Courtney had accumulated a great many
references and four years of work in preparation of the
<i>Register</i> greatly increased the number. He acknowledges
the assistance of G. L. Apperson, who later published a
useful collection of English proverbs, and Robert A. Peddie,
who wrote a very large subject bibliography. He has
taken references from Henri Stein's <i>Manuel</i>, especially references
in the Slavic languages.</p>

<p>He found that the vast number of bibliographies in
print made necessary some limitations on the scope of his
work. He excludes sale catalogues (although a few are
cited), catalogues of manuscripts, and lists of maps and
charts. Probably few will quarrel with his decision. He
also omits many headings in the bibliography of geology,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>India, and other unspecified large fields. Here it would be
helpful to know more accurately what these omissions
were.</p>

<p>Courtney's <i>Register</i> lists some 30,000 titles in a main
and two supplementary alphabets. The rapid growth of
the material as he proceeded with his work explains this inconvenient
division. The very numerous citations of bibliographies
in non-bibliographical works contribute to this
large figure. I cannot estimate closely the number of small
headings, which run into the thousands. The bulk of the
<i>Register</i> and the ease with which it can be used make it
valuable. As examples of the wealth of information in it,
I cite his references to thirteen bibliographies of bacteriology,
seventeen bibliographies of hymns, nine bibliographies
of insanity, and three bibliographies of swimming.
One will rarely leave the <i>Register</i> empty-handed.</p>

<p>Courtney could have greatly reduced the size of his
book without a sacrifice of convenience or the loss of significant
references. His alphabetical arrangement makes it
unnecessary to repeat the headings in the index. He could
have profitably used the space saved to add a descriptive
word that would differentiate the various works by one
author. The dozen references to J. C. Pilling, who wrote
bibliographies of American Indian languages, might, for
example, have been identified by appropriate adjectives.
Courtney could have reduced the size of his book substantially
and without loss by omitting bibliographies printed in
obvious places, to which one needs no reference. For example,
he could have spared references to bibliographies
in four editions of <i>Beowulf</i>. The poorly-organized longer
articles in the <i>Register</i> are often burdened with miscellaneous
or unnecessary information. The article "Bibliography"
includes, for example, the universal bibliographies
by Georg Draud and Theophil Georgi, (but not
Conrad Gesner); Olphar Hamst, <i>Aggravating Ladies</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
which is a list of pseudonymous books written by "A
Lady";<a name="FNanchor_192_193" id="FNanchor_192_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_193" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
the bibliographical journal <i>La Bibliofilia</i>;<a name="FNanchor_193_194" id="FNanchor_193_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_194" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and
a bibliography of church history. This is not a display of
good workmanship. The article "Libraries" is a similar farrago
of Namur's bibliography of bibliographies, Wheatley's
book on how to make a library, Edward Edwards' book on
libraries and their founders, Meusel's biographical dictionary
of German artists, and other books of as little pertinence.
There is very useful information to be gleaned from
Courtney's <i>Register</i> and one can easily find it in the chaff.</p>

<p>We are still too close to the latest bibliographies of
bibliographies to see them in a true perspective.<a name="FNanchor_194_195" id="FNanchor_194_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_195" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Efforts
to make a comprehensive bibliography of bibliographies
continue and a new development that was foreshadowed
in Sabin's restriction of his work to a single language with
"more than a few" titles added to fill it out is apparent in
some less extensive but very excellent bibliographies of
bibliographies.</p>

<p>The death of Vilhelm Grundtvig (1866-1950) and the
destruction of his collectanea during the war make it certain
that the bibliography of bibliographies that he and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Joris Vorstius planned will never appear. He had called
for help in the enterprise in an article<a name="FNanchor_195_196" id="FNanchor_195_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_196" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> published in 1926
and had obtained approval of it at the international meeting
of librarians at Madrid in 1935. During the course of
his work he succeeded in gaining the assistance of Joris
Vorstius, whom we have learned to know as the editor of
annual surveys of current bibliographies. He wrote in 1940
in a review of Theodore Besterman, <i>A World Bibliography
of Bibliographies</i>, that his collectanea were arranged according
to countries for submission to various workers who
might criticize and supplement them.<a name="FNanchor_196_197" id="FNanchor_196_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_197" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The loss of this
compilation is greatly to be regretted because the experience
and good judgment of the two editors make it certain
that the book would have been comprehensive, well-planned,
and satisfactorily executed.</p>

<p>On several occasions Grundtvig stated briefly the task
of making a bibliography of bibliographies. His ability to
see clearly its difficulties, his wide reading, and his recognition
of the many types of bibliographical works that must
be considered make these preliminary statements valuable.
A long article of 1903 entitled "Gedanken über Bibliographie"<a name="FNanchor_197_198" id="FNanchor_197_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_198" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
was suggested by A. G. S. Josephson's pamphlet,
which will be mentioned later. Here Grundtvig points out
the varieties of existing bibliographies and their defects
and gives examples of unfamiliar or neglected varieties.
For example, he comments (pp. 415-417) on the lists of
antiquarian catalogues and catalogues of private libraries.
Although we now have more information about these catalogues
than Grundtvig found in 1903, we still have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>critical bibliographies of them. He points out (p. 418) the
unsatisfactory quality of bibliographies of ephemeral publications
(chapbooks and the like) and surveys the available
lists. He has, to be sure, overlooked one of the earliest
of such lists&mdash;Giovanni Cinelli Calvoli, <i>Della biblioteca
volante</i> (Padua, 1677-1716; 2d ed., 1734-1747. ICN [2d
ed.])&mdash;but it is rare and virtually unknown. He comments
incisively on the lists of collective biographies (pp.
420, 441) and suggests the need for a more critical survey
of them.<a name="FNanchor_198_199" id="FNanchor_198_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_199" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Although Grundtvig's article is not easy reading,
it is a very stimulating survey of bibliographies. Any
writer of a bibliography of bibliographies should read it
attentively.</p>

<p>Grundtvig's pamphlet of 1919, entitled <i>Om Bibliografi
og Bibliografier</i>, is much more conveniently arranged than
the article of 1903. It is a review of the bibliographical
chapter in Svend Dahl, <i>Haandbog i Bibliotekskundskab</i>.
He finds it very unsatisfactory and shows how it might
have been written. He gives a brief survey of bibliographies
in general (pp. 8-10), comments on the making
of collectanea and their arrangement (pp. 10-13) and the
varieties of bibliographies including those in non-bibliographical
works (pp. 14-19), and surveys bibliographies
of bibliographies (pp. 19-23), international bibliographies
(pp. 23-25), and national bibliographies (pp. 25-29). In
keeping with his purpose, he names only the most obvious
works.</p>

<p>We come now to the largest of all bibliographies of
bibliographies: Theodore Besterman, <i>A World Bibliography
of Bibliographies</i> (1939-1940; 2d ed., 1947-1949).
Since the two editions do not differ essentially in character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>I have found it convenient and probably more helpful
to the reader to cite illustrations of Besterman's method
from the second edition and to conclude my remarks with
brief comment on the changes and improvements made in
this edition. The plan of Besterman's book is novel in
many details. It is, like Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i> of 1812, an
alphabetical list of many small headings. Courtney had
adopted the same plan in his <i>Register</i> (1905-1912), but
few others have seen the great merits of this arrangement.
In giving bibliographical details Besterman goes far beyond
anything that had been previously attempted. He
gives more complete collations than any of his predecessors
except Petzholdt had given, and in several regards
surpasses Petzholdt. He describes carefully such long sets
as the <i>Catalogue of Books in the Library of the Surgeon
Generals Office</i> (cols. 1866-1867), the many national bibliographies
made by booksellers or librarians, and the annual
bibliographies of special fields like <i>The Record of
Zoological Literature</i> and its continuation (cols. 3187-3189).
He goes beyond Petzholdt and most other bibliographers
by estimating the number of titles cited in the
books that he lists. He ranges farther afield than any of
his predecessors. He includes lists of maps and printed
music, registers of documents and charters, and indexes of
laws and patents. He includes catalogues of manuscripts
and specialized catalogues of books in institutional libraries
but not general catalogues of books owned by the
same libraries. He includes a generous selection of specialized
catalogues of private libraries. He brings more
Finnish, Hungarian, and Slavic titles than anyone before
him and regrets his inability to include books in Oriental
languages. In the first edition he intended to cite all bibliographies
printed as books that had appeared before
1936 and succeeded in picking up a large number of those
printed between 1936 and 1939. He says that he has cited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
three times as many bibliographies printed before 1860 as
Petzholdt had found. This comparison gives an idea of
the amazing extent of Besterman's work.</p>

<p>Besterman sees clearly the difficulties inherent in his
choice of an alphabetical arrangement of many small
headings and finds perhaps the only answer. It is to offer
an abundance of cross-references. Although these headings
can be found in special dictionaries that cite synonyms
and related words, it remains to be seen how well
they will stand the test of time. A suggestion of what may
happen is perhaps already to be found in the general unfamiliarity
of scholars with these dictionaries. Librarians
know and use them, but scholars do not. The time may
come when only a specialist and indeed only a specialist
acquainted with the history of his discipline will know
the meaning of many headings. The headings used in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are obsolete. As we
have seen, Petzholdt did not recognize the meaning of philosophy
that was accepted in the early seventeenth century.
I have remarked upon the unfamiliarity of modern students
of theology with Peignot's term <i>théologie positive</i>.
Can we expect future scholars to perceive readily the difference
between psychiatry and psychoanalysis? Unless
they do, they will not find it easy to use a bibliography
of bibliographies arranged as an alphabetical dictionary of
many small headings. There is, as a matter of fact, no
better illustration of these difficulties than the word "bibliography"
itself. This very interesting word needs a historical
and lexicographical investigation that will continue
Pierre Frieden's article, "Bibliographie. Etymologie et
histoire du mot," <i>Revue de synthèse</i>, VII (1934), 45-52.
During this century "bibliography" has been used more
and more often to refer to either a study of a book as a
physical object or to a list of titles having some common
quality. In such titles as Theodore Besterman, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span><i>A World
Bibliography of Bibliographies</i>, and Norman E. Binns, <i>An
Introduction to Historical Bibliography</i> (London, 1953),
the word has two quite different meanings.</p>

<p>Besterman's enormous compilation does not include
all the available bibliographies. Vilhelm Grundtvig found
some four hundred titles that had escaped Besterman in
the first edition and came regretfully to the conclusion
that the hope for a wholly satisfactory international bibliography
of bibliographies was now unlikely to be realized.<a name="FNanchor_199_200" id="FNanchor_199_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_200" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
His judgment is severe and the second edition
has no doubt gone a long way toward removing these
defects. A third edition of the <i>World Bibliography</i> (1955) is
now in process, with the first volume already off the press.
It will contain some 80,000 titles, an increase of one-third
over the second edition.</p>

<p>A few difficulties in Besterman's bibliography concern
what have been called "linked" books. These are
works having their own title pages but issued in conjunction
with another book.<a name="FNanchor_200_201" id="FNanchor_200_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_201" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Unless they have been catalogued
as separate works, they are virtually impossible
to identify. We have already seen what annoyance a title
of this sort can cause in the case of Labbé's bibliography
of bibliographies published in 1653.</p>

<p>I cannot reach a decision altogether satisfactory to
myself regarding Besterman's inclusion of "abridgments of
patent specifications" (I, p. xv). These contain bibliographical
information not readily obtainable from any
other source, and my disposition is inclined toward generosity.
By including them Besterman offers a much more
adequate representation of scientific and technological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>bibliography than would otherwise have been possible. As
he correctly says (I, p. xvii), an interest in the fields of
humane studies has been predominant in earlier bibliographies
of bibliographies. On the other hand, Besterman
seems, in including these abridgments, to have
stretched to the breaking point his rule for the exclusion
of bibliographies contained in non-bibliographical works.
If these abridgments are to be included, then one is
tempted to call attention to the fact that many German
doctoral dissertations offer good bibliographies of small
subjects and can be very useful on occasion.<a name="FNanchor_201_202" id="FNanchor_201_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_202" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Any definition of a bibliography is difficult to formulate
and even more difficult to adhere to. I cite only
one more illustration of the problems that arise. Besterman
cites (col. 1040) Antti Aarne's catalogue of printed
and manuscript versions of Finnish tales. This is clearly
within his definition of a bibliography. Perhaps a score
of similar catalogues for the tales of countries from
Iceland to Rumania are in existence and might equally
well have been cited. Although it is not made according
to Aarne's pattern, the <i>Typen türkischer Volksmärchen</i>
(Wiesbaden, 1953) by Wolfram Eberhard and P. N. Boratav
is a similar catalogue of tales. How far shall one go
in seeking out such extremely technical reference aids as
these? The specialist will know them, and few others can
use them with any comfort. Students of folklore have done
a great deal of indexing and cataloguing and have produced
works that can only be separated from bibliographies
with difficulty. What shall one say of John Meier,
<i>Kunstlieder im Volksmunde</i> (Halle, 1906)? This is a
catalogue of German songs that have been heard in oral
tradition but can be traced back to known authors. Meier
gives full references to the sources in both the printed
works of the authors and the collections of folksongs. To
return to tales once more, I mention two books of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>apparently wholly bibliographical nature that Besterman
does not mention. A. C. Lee, <i>The Decameron. Its Sources
and Analogues</i> (London, 1909) is, as its title indicates,
a compilation of tales related to those in the <i>Decameron</i>.
The <i>Anmerkungen zu den Kinder- und Hausmärchen der
Brüder Grimm</i> (5 v.; Leipzig, 1913-1932) by Johannes
Bolte and Georg Polívka is a bibliography of parallels to
the <i>Household Tales</i>.</p>

<p>Some details in Besterman's work call for comment
or correction, but their number is negligible in view of the
vast number of titles with which he deals. There are
instances in which I should disagree with him in the classification
of titles. For example, the Augsburg library
catalogue of 1600 (col. 626) is not a bibliography of classical
literature but a general catalogue of books and
manuscripts in the Augsburg municipal library. Furthermore,
its inclusion contradicts the principle stated in the
Introduction (I, p. xiv) according to which general catalogues
of institutional libraries are omitted. J. B. Mencken's
<i>Gelehrten-Lexicon</i> with the second and third editions
by C. G. Jöcher is cited (col. 331) as a universal bibliography,
but Jöcher's later and much larger revision with
its continuations is cited (col. 343) in a different category
as a select universal bibliography. Errors in names, place
names, and dates appear to be very few. I note that
Thomas Cremius (col. 340) should be Thomas Crenius.
Such details scarcely call for comment, and their lack of
importance is itself a characterization of Besterman's skill.
I could wish that the Preface to volume III had explained
at greater length the alphabetization of anonymous titles
beginning with such words as "Catalogue" or "Index." For
example, I cannot find the <i>International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature</i> in the Index, although Section N for
Zoology is cited in col. 3188. Nor is the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><i>International
Catalogue</i> in the article "Science" (cols. 2725-2749), where
a <i>List of Journals</i> connected with it is cited (col. 2727).</p>

<p>Besterman's bibliography deserves special praise for
the fact that it rests on a personal inspection of virtually
all the works cited. It needs scarcely to be said that he
could have executed this task only at the British Museum
or in a few other very great libraries. We can probably
infer that Conrad Gesner handled the bibliographies that
he cited in 1548, but few later workers have been equally
successful in seeing all the books that they name. In this
regard Gabriel Peignot made a long step in advance in
the <i>Répertoire</i> of 1812. The character of his comments
makes it clear that he had a firsthand knowledge of the
books that he cites. In 1838 his successor Pie Namur
yielded countless times to the temptation to cite books
from secondary sources, which moreover he does not name.
In 1866 Julius Petzholdt established the standards of bibliographical
accuracy that ought to be observed and indicated
the books that he had not consulted, but his successors
have not in general approached these standards.
It is therefore altogether gratifying to praise Besterman's
attention to such bibliographical details as collations, the
citation of editions, and the identification of pseudonyms.
In addition to these merits the correctness of the Index
calls for particular mention. The bibliographies named in
this essay have not always required an index, but those
which do contain one have usually served their readers
poorly. Philippe Labbé was the first but by no means the
last of our bibliographers to offer his reader an unsatisfactory
index. Even Julius Petzholdt left much to be
desired in this regard. The index to Henri Stein's <i>Manuel</i>
is conspicuous for its faults. In comparison with his predecessors
Besterman's success in the making of an index
is all the more meritorious.</p>

<p>In a second edition published between 1947 and 1949,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Besterman revised his bibliography to include books printed
as late as 1944 and 1945. Since I have referred to this and
not to the first edition in my comments, it is sufficient to
quote Besterman's statement of the differences between
the two editions. The improvements and changes are important
to every user of the book but do not affect its nature
in any fundamental way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Large parts of the field have been surveyed anew, the text has
been minutely revised throughout, and improvements made. The
number of cross-references has been multiplied. Most important,
however, are the new entries, which make this edition over 55
per centum bigger than the first. The number of volumes recorded
and separately collated is now about 65,000. Nearly all
intermediate editions [between the first and last] have now been
deleted; they have only been retained, in fact, for bibliographies
first published before 1800, and for those of special interest or
importance.<a name="FNanchor_202_203" id="FNanchor_202_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_203" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And now, five years after the completion of the second edition,
Besterman has begun to print a third edition, which
he declares to be a "final" edition. As he writes in a letter
of July 27, 1954, the new edition will show "the normal increase
in size due to the passage of time." A systematic
check of Library of Congress holdings has enabled him to
strengthen considerably the coverage of American bibliographical
publication, north and south. He has also made
renewed efforts to improve the representation of scientific
and Slavic books. The first volume, which is now in proof,
will appear early in 1955 and three more volumes will follow.
One lays <i>A World Bibliography of Bibliographies</i>
aside with astonishment that one man had the courage to
conceive the task and the strength to complete it. In its
conception of universality and its success in approaching
completeness Besterman's book is a climax in this history of
bibliographies of bibliographies.</p>

<p>An emphasis on the current usefulness of the works
cited is characteristic of the last four bibliographies of bibliographies
that I shall name. These compilations by Bohatta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Funke, and Hodes; by Collison; by Malclès; and by Totok
and Weitzel are intentionally selective in nature and
will therefore require only brief comment. Incidentally,
they do not owe their origin to Besterman's suggestion: "it
will no doubt eventually become necessary to publish a
general bibliography of <em>best</em> bibliographies" (I, p. xvii),
although they serve this purpose more or less adequately.
The practical emphasis in these four bibliographies betrays
the training of their authors in librarianship.</p>

<p>There is a significant difference between the idea of a
bibliography as a complete record of books on a particular
subject or of a particular kind and that of bibliographies
of bibliographies as they have been ordinarily
made. To some extent every bibliography serves a practical
need, but bibliographies of bibliographies have at first
served this need somewhat unconsciously and have served
it more and more deliberately as time has passed. As my
comments in this essay have shown, the bibliography of
bibliographies has been characteristically a tool having
immediate practical usefulness. There are few exceptions
to this rule: Namur's careless book of 1838, Besterman's
book that we have just examined, and Josephson's bibliography
of bibliographies of bibliographies that we shall
mention at the end of this chapter include works that the
compilers regarded as having historical interest rather than
practical value. Conrad Gesner named in 1548 a considerable
number of classical Greek and Latin works because
they seemed to his contemporaries to serve their needs.
This aspect of immediate contemporary usefulness has
remained characteristic of bibliographies of bibliographies
down to the present time. References to classical authorities
had still a certain degree of practical value for Labbé
(1664) and Teissier (1686, 1705). They have disappeared
completely or almost completely from later bibliographies
of bibliographies. During the last century this emphasis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
on immediate contemporary usefulness has perhaps expressed
itself more clearly in acts than in words. For
example, Peignot in 1812 is already looking in this direction.
Although subsequent bibliographers may include outmoded
books, their eyes turn, as Petzholdt's did in 1866, more
and more consciously to modern writings. The four most
recent bibliographies of bibliographies recognize fully that
they intend to be primarily guides to the best modern
sources of information.</p>

<p>In spite of its brave title, <i>Internationale Bibliographie
der Bibliographien</i> (1939-1950), this book by Hanns Bohatta
(1864-1950), Walter Funke, and Franz Hodes belongs
on the level of bibliographies by Durey de Noinville and
Michael de San José. It will only rarely aid either the beginner
or the more advanced scholar. It is a selective
bibliography and the choice of titles will satisfy no
one. Obvious books are lacking<a name="FNanchor_203_204" id="FNanchor_203_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_204" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and worthless compilations
are present.<a name="FNanchor_204_205" id="FNanchor_204_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_205" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The authors pay little attention to the
categories that they set up.<a name="FNanchor_205_206" id="FNanchor_205_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_206" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The references are incomplete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>and inaccurate.<a name="FNanchor_206_207" id="FNanchor_206_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_207" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The comments are often misleading
or erroneous. For example, the remark that Giuseppe Fumagalli,
<i>La bibliografia</i>, is much less complete than Giuseppe
Ottino and Giuseppe Fumagalli, <i>Biblioteca bibliografica
italiana</i>, is a fundamental misapprehension of both works.
The first is a handbook of general bibliography; the second
is a bibliography of bibliographies written in Italian or concerned
with Italy. The second book belongs elsewhere and
the supplements to it should be cited at length because they
were written, in part, by other authors. A comparison of
the two books is without point. With all its faults this
disorderly <i>Internationale Bibliographie der Bibliographien</i>
yields useful information.<a name="FNanchor_207_208" id="FNanchor_207_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_208" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The most ambitious and the best of these four modern
selective bibliographies is L.-N. Malclès, <i>Les Sources du
travail bibliographique</i>, I (Geneva, 1950). This deals with
general works and cites almost exclusively bibliographies.
A second volume (2 pts., Geneva, 1952), which deals with
the humanities, has recently appeared. A third volume,
which will deal with the sciences, is promised. An abbreviated
edition has been published even though volume 3 has
not yet been issued. Both the second and the promised
third volume are subject bibliographies and therefore need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>no mention here. The first volume contains some information
about books that are not bibliographies, although they
are somewhat similar in nature to bibliographies. There is,
for example, a very interesting chapter on encyclopedias
(pp. 213-224) and another chapter (pp. 225-237) on collective
biographies. The wholly practical spirit of Mlle.
Malclès's endeavor appears clearly in her list of German
encyclopedias. She is right in thinking that a modern
worker will rarely look at a German encyclopedia older
than Ersch and Gruber ("1818-1889, 97 vol. 4<sup>o</sup> [A-Z]").
The reference is, incidentally, not quite accurate, since
large portions of the alphabet were never written. We hear
nothing of the early German encyclopedist J. H. Alsted,
who lived and wrote two generations before Louis Moréri
(he is mentioned as the first French author of an encyclopedia
on p. 219), or of Krünitz and Zedler, who wrote vast
encyclopedias almost two centuries ago. Such German
works are not appropriate to Mlle. Malclès's purpose, but
their absence means that her book does not serve a student
who wishes to inform himself about the historical development
of encyclopedias. In other words, Mlle. Malclès has
deliberately and successfully satisfied the needs of French
scholars.</p>

<p>Mlle. Malclès's admirably organized and very rich list
of currently useful bibliographies is, as Joris Vorstius says
in his review, indispensable to every librarian. Particularly
interesting are the introductory remarks in each chapter.
These describe the general nature of the works listed and
offer comparisons and critical comment on the value and
purpose of the different works. This excellent orientation
supplements the brief descriptive remarks attached to the
titles. As I have already implied, <i>Les Sources du travail
bibliographique</i> has been written for French reference librarians.
For this reason Mlle. Malclès is often content to
cite secondary authorities for bibliographies not written in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
French or concerned with subjects of minor interest to
French students. This admirable book stands at the peak
of selective bibliographies of bibliographies and is therefore
a companion to Besterman's comprehensive work.</p>

<p>Robert L. Collison, <i>Bibliographies Subject and National.
A Guide to their contents, arrangement and use</i>
(London, 1951) is a pleasant little book containing the
information promised in its title. It is a rare example of a
bibliography written in a descriptive style that relieves the
tedium of a list. The author has intended to offer no more
than a brief handlist of currently useful works with some
interpretative comments. He has succeeded well in his
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_208_209" id="FNanchor_208_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_209" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>A recently published German counterpart to Malclès
and Collison is Wilhelm Totok and Rolf Weitzel, <i>Handbuch
der bibliographischen Nachschlagewerke</i> (1954). Less
comprehensive than the French book and much richer than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>the English one, it is a meritorious compendium of currently
useful bibliographies in all fields. The authors list bibliographies,
library catalogues, biographical and biobibliographical
handbooks, general and specialized encyclopedias, and
treatises of various sorts that contain bibliographical information.
Historical and descriptive remarks that are often
very instructive introduce the chapters and sections and
critical comments usually are appended to the titles cited.
The choice of titles will, as the authors no doubt intended,
serve best German readers. For example, no Spanish, Latin
American, or Russian dictionaries of anonyma and pseudonyma
are mentioned (pp. 70-73). I should scarcely agree
with the opinion (p. 70) that interest in dictionaries of this
sort subsided after the first decades of this century. An emphasis
on modern writing often leads the authors to overlook
earlier bibliographies that have not lost their usefulness.
For example, Mundt's incomplete list (extending only
to R) of European dissertations published before 1900 (p.
75) is not "the only means of identifying older university
publications (dissertations)." The <i>Catalogus dissertationum
academicarum quibus nuper aucta est Bibliotheca Bodleiana
MDCCCXXXII</i> (Oxford, 1834) will serve this purpose
very well and extends to the end of the alphabet. Bibliographies
of university dissertations were, moreover, published
in the early eighteenth century. I cannot understand
why the authors chose to omit John Meier's enormous bibliography
of German folklore in Hermann Paul, ed., <i>Grundriss
der germanischen Philologie</i>, III (2d ed., Strassburg,
1909) or why they preferred Wilhelm Pessler's handbook
of German folklore to the exclusion of the convenient bibliography
in Adolf Spamer, <i>Die deutsche Volkskunde</i> (2d
ed. [unchanged], Berlin, 1934-1935). Suggestions of this
sort occur readily enough to any attentive reader and are
intended to characterize the book rather than to point out
its deficiencies. In my opinion, the authors have succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
well in their intention which was to write a book occupying
a position between a bulky guide to information and a beginner's
handbook ("Vorwort," p. v).</p>

<p>We have come finally to the last bibliography of all. Its
date (1901) entitles it to the first place in this chapter, but
it stands last because it is an even more specialized compilation
than a bibliography of bibliographies. This bibliography
of bibliographies of bibliographies, that is to say,
a bibliography in the third degree, is entitled <i>Bibliographies
of Bibliographies</i>. The author is Aksel G. S. Josephson, a
former member of the staff of the John Crerar Library. It
is a chronological list of one hundred and fifty-six bibliographies
of bibliographies. The conception is not new, but
this pamphlet is the first separate publication of such a list.
Similar lists are found of course in Peignot's <i>Répertoire</i> of
1812, Petzholdt's <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> of 1866, and a
great variety of other reference works. The pertinent sections
in handbooks of library science, bibliography, and the
like are usually of little interest or value, but Josephson
lists them carefully. Perhaps forty titles that he names are
significant. He has chosen the strange plan of a chronological
arrangement of titles and adds to its inconvenience
by providing neither an author nor a subject index. He
has yielded to the temptation to include titles of no pertinence
like treatises on systems of cataloguing (Nos. 41,
43),<a name="FNanchor_209_210" id="FNanchor_209_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_210" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> H. B. Wheatley's <i>What Is an Index?</i> (No. 59), a
guide for making a pastor's library (No. 77), a list of fictitious
books (No. 80), and guides to the use of a library
(Nos. 67, 69, 104). The many references to bibliographies
in the <i>Neuer Anzeiger für Bibliographie und Bibliothekswesen</i>
are no doubt pertinent but are scarcely as important
as they are numerous. He has probably more references
to bibliographical lists published in journals of library
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>science than any other source of information.<a name="FNanchor_210_211" id="FNanchor_210_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_211" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The
value of Josephson's pamphlet lies in an arrangement that
makes apparent the historical development and emphasizes
the growth of bibliographical lists in journals. Mistakes
seem to be few.<a name="FNanchor_211_212" id="FNanchor_211_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_212" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>In making a second edition of the <i>Bibliography of
Bibliographies</i> Josephson profited greatly from the long
criticism by Vilhelm Grundtvig that we have already discussed.
He replaced the chronological arrangement by a
classified arrangement, within which he arranged titles
chronologically. He added many new titles that he had
found or had excerpted from Grundtvig's criticism. His
retirement from active duty and long delays in publication
greatly handicapped him in producing a satisfactory piece
of work.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VI" id="Chapter_VI">Chapter VI</a><br />

<small>Conclusion</small></h2>


<p>Four centuries have elapsed since Conrad Gesner published
the first modern bibliography of bibliographies in
the <i>Pandectae</i> of 1548. Although it was only a section in
a general subject index, it shows Gesner's clear understanding
of the task and a competent choice and arrangement
of materials. Few later efforts have been equally successful.
His definition of a bibliography is both narrower and
broader than the one that has since found general acceptance.
He does not include, for example, biobibliographical
accounts of religious orders and nations. He was familiar
with them but probably looked upon them as historical
rather than bibliographical compilations. Like most later
bibliographers, he does not include publishers' catalogues
and catalogues of books owned by institutions and individuals.
In 1598 Israel Spach employed what is virtually the
modern definition of a bibliography. Like Gesner, he includes
bibliographers who wrote in classical times. In 1628
Francis Sweerts almost takes the decisive step of making an
independent list composed of bibliographies of bibliographies.
The three folio pages in his <i>Athenae Belgicae</i> on
which this list appears have no organic connection with
that biobibliographical dictionary. Sweerts includes, furthermore,
no ancient bibliographers. His work has a modern
look.</p>

<p>In 1643 the bibliography of bibliographies comes of
age with the announcement of Jodocus a Dudinck, <i>Bibliothecariographia</i>.
The book is lost or more probably was
never published, but its subtitle shows a clear comprehension
of the nature of a bibliography of bibliographies. Philip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Labbé published a bibliography of bibliographies in 1653
and a new edition of it in 1664. His loyalty to Catholicism
and his exclusively French associations hindered its wide
acceptance and use. Few of his contemporaries understood
what he had done, and few learned how to use his book.
Even Antoine Teissier, who revised and enlarged it, showed
an imperfect understanding of its nature. The age was not
ready for a bibliography of bibliographies. Cornelius a
Beughem, a man of many bibliographies, may have perceived
the situation, for he never published the compilation
that he had announced in 1680. With the publication of
a supplement to Teissier's revision of Labbé, efforts to make
a bibliography of bibliographies came to a dead stop in
1705. They had resulted in a formulation of the task.</p>

<p>After 1705 no bibliography of bibliographies appeared
for more than a century. The fragmentary tradition of listing
books entitled <i>bibliotheca</i>, i.e. bibliography or catalogue,
that might have led to one produced only withered
shoots and ended in 1758 with Durey de Noinville's wretched
compilation. During the eighteenth century the bibliography
of bibliographies is, at best, only a chapter in surveys
of learning. No doubt the great encyclopedias of the time
satisfied scholarly demands so well that men did not
perceive the place that a bibliography of bibliographies
might fill.</p>

<p>Conrad Gesner, whom I regard as the first modern
writer of a bibliography of bibliographies, aimed at comprehensiveness
and included works of all ages as far as they
came to his knowledge. He named Amphicrates and his
contemporary Jakob Rueff in the same list without making
a distinction between them. Almost immediately the bibliography
of bibliographies became a guide to currently
useful reference works and it has retained that function.
Writing in the early years of the seventeenth century, Paul
Bolduan and Francis Sweerts took a step away from comprehensiveness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
They included no classical Greek and Latin
authorities and very few medieval ones. This exclusion of
classical writers runs parallel to the similar treatment of
classical writers of history. In a list of classical historians
we no longer cite Xenophon and Caesar along with Grote
and Gibbon. No one thinks of naming a bibliographer like
Cicero, Suetonius, or St. Jerome in the company of Petzholdt
and Brunet. Although this rejection of ancient bibliographers
began in the early seventeenth century, neither
Labbé in 1664 nor Teissier in 1705 fully accepted it.</p>

<p>By 1812 we find a completely modern conception of
bibliography. Gabriel Peignot cites no bibliographer from
classical times and names only such older writers of the
Renaissance as have not been superseded by more recent
authorities. This definition of the bibliography of bibliographies
makes it practically useful to the writer's contemporaries.
With the exception of Theodore Besterman, the
subsequent writers of bibliographies of bibliographies have
been practical men who see a modern librarian's needs and
more especially, when that functionary is invented, the
needs of a reference librarian. Julius Petzholdt admits
many old bibliographies to his <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i>
of 1866, but gives them room only for historical reasons or
in the absence of a modern work. Joseph Sabin goes somewhat
farther by restricting himself to British and American
bibliographies with only a side glance at those in other
than European languages. Léon Vallée, Henri Stein, W.
P. Courtney, and those who come after show a more and
more definitely acknowledged restriction to modern works
and especially those within the easy reach of their readers.
The bibliography of bibliographies becomes an ever more
skilfully fashioned key to unlock modern learning and
modern libraries. In the last two generations cooperative
effort has become characteristic of much bibliographical
work and the publication of periodical surveys limited to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
brief periods and cumulated for longer intervals reflect
both the difficulty of the task and the emphasis on contemporary
usefulness. The standards of accuracy and,
within the limits that have been accepted, the standards
of completeness have enormously improved.</p>

<p>This brief historical summary makes it plain that a
bibliography is or, at least, it has become a reference work
that gives a limited amount of information of a very special
kind. It is immediately useful in an emergency and less
likely to be helpful in surveying historically any particular
field of study. A corollary is the fact that a bibliography
of bibliographies will ordinarily give a student little or
no new information about a subject with which he is
familiar, but can be a valuable aid to him in an unfamiliar
field. A student of Renaissance English literature will not
consult a bibliography of bibliographies to learn of such
works as the <i>Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature</i>
or A. W. Pollard and G. R. Redgrave, A <i>Short-Title
Catalogue of Books Printed in England ... 1475-1640</i>.
He already knows them. He may be very glad to find
the titles of bibliographies of theology, history, or science
that meet his needs. He should consult, also, the older
books that Besterman alone among modern writers of the
bibliography of bibliographies is likely to cite. Joris Vorstius
rightly emphasizes the fact that a bibliography of bibliographies
serves primarily a reference librarian.<a name="FNanchor_212_213" id="FNanchor_212_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_213" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> I should
only enlarge upon his remark by saying that the older
bibliographies of bibliographies are invaluable and all too
little known aids to understanding the historical development
of a discipline or the background of an earlier period.</p>

<p>With all their faults and insufficiencies&mdash;and what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>human works lack them?&mdash;bibliographies of bibliographies
are very valuable aids to scholars. As an introduction
to a strange field one will naturally consult only the
most recently published examples, beginning with Julius
Petzholdt, <i>Bibliotheca bibliographica</i> (1866) or perhaps
even with Theodore Besterman, <i>A World Bibliography of
Bibliographies</i> (2d ed., 1947-1949; 3d ed., 1955-). In
studying the historical development of a discipline or subject
one can neglect the four oldest bibliographies of bibliographies.
Gesner's <i>Pandectae</i>, Spach's <i>Nomenclator</i>, and
Bolduan's <i>Bibliotheca philosophica</i> are general subject
bibliographies of a sort that I hope to discuss at another
time. These books and Sweert's <i>Athenae Belgicae</i> contain
little or nothing as far as bibliographies are concerned
that cannot be more easily found in other books. With
the sole exception of Labbé's <i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i>,
which was absorbed into Teissier's <i>Catalogus auctorum</i>, a
student of the historical aspect of a subject must consult
all the bibliographies of bibliographies printed after 1664.
They are independent or almost independent compilations
and supplement one another. Fortunately they are not
extremely difficult to obtain. In consulting them the modern
scholar should give thanks to those who have labored
so diligently in his behalf.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
St. Jerome has in mind the <i>De illustribus grammaticis</i> and <i>De
rhetoribus</i> by Suetonius. For a discussion of Latin writers of biobibliography
see Wilhelm Ludwig Schmidt, <i>De Romanorum imprimis
Suetonii arte biographica</i> (Diss.; Marburg, 1891).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Hermippus of Smyrna wrote on legislators, the Seven Sages,
and the pupils of Isocrates. He or another Hermippus wrote a <i>De
viris illustribus</i>, which is probably the book intended by St. Jerome.
For more information about Hermippus and the other writers mentioned
in this passage see Joannes Jonsius, <i>De scriptoribus historiae
philosophiae</i> (Frankfurt a.M., 1659) and such a modern authority
as Wilhelm von Christ, <i>Geschichte der griechischen Literatur</i> (6th
ed., Munich, 1920). I recommend Jonsius because he makes clear
the bibliographical aspect of these writers. There is no adequate
account of classical Greek and Latin bibliographical writings.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Antigonus, who is often cited by Diogenes Laertius in his biobibliography
of philosophers, wrote a general biobibliography that is
now lost.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
Satyrus wrote a <i>De viris illustribus</i> in dialogue that may have
been Plutarch's model.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
The polymath Aristoxenus is credited with a book on the
writers of tragedy. This may be the book intended here. Plutarch
admired his biographical dictionary. See Jonsius, pp. 73-78.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
Pliny (<i>Natural History</i>, 35.2) cites Varro's <i>De imaginibus</i> which
contained five hundred or more <i>imagines</i> or characterizations, probably
with illustrations. Varro also wrote accounts of poets, rhetoricians,
and libraries.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>

dictionary.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
Quoted from the edition of St. Jerome's <i>De viris illustribus</i> in
J. A. Fabricius, <i>Bibliotheca ecclesiastica</i>, Hamburg, 1718, p. 13. I
have used this edition because it contains useful notes on these
authors.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<i>Mundus Marianus, hoc est: Specificatio omnium mundi locorum,
in quibus B. Virgo Deipara miraculose colitur.</i> This work and
Dudinck's promised <i>Synopsis bibliothecae Marianae</i> were duplicated
by Hippolytus Marraccius (1604-1675). His <i>Bibliotheca Mariana</i>
(Rome, 1648) filled the place of the <i>Synopsis</i>. Marraccius, who
gave his life to the service of the Virgin, tried vainly to find Dudinck's
books. He said in 1648 of his search for the <i>Mundus</i> and
<i>Synopsis</i>: "Illa etenim licet ardentissima concupitata, videre adhuc
non meruit" (<i>Bibliotheca Mariana</i>, p. 813). If Marraccius, whose
brother listed one hundred and fifteen works from his pen, published
and unpublished, all dealing with the Virgin, could not find
Dudinck's books soon after their supposed appearance, we cannot
hope to be more successful. The <i>Mundus Marianus</i> is now replaced
by E. M. Oettinger, <i>Iconographia Mariana oder Versuch
einer Literatur der wunderthätigen Marienbilder, geordnet nach
alphabetischer Reihenfolge der Orte, in welchen sie verehrt werden</i>

His name is often misspelled. He is the author of a famous
catalogue of the Ingolstadt university library that employed a novel
scheme of classification. All or almost all the references to Ferg and
the catalogue have been made at second-hand. I have seen half a
dozen different dates of publication. I believe it was never published.
At any rate, the manuscript catalogue by Ferg was carried
off in 1945 "by unknown persons in an unknown direction" from
the place where the manuscripts belonging to the library of the
University of Munich were stored.</p></div>

For example, the reference to "Thomas Reinesius ep. 38"
in the article Joannes Frinsheimius was not very difficult to find
in 1664. Only the <i>Epistolae</i> addressed to Caspar Hoffmann and
C. A. Rupert (Leipzig, 1660) were then in print. Henri Stegemeier
has kindly verified the reference, which will be found on
p. 311, in the copy at the University of Illinois. There are, to be
sure, other collections of letters by Reinesius, but these were published
after 1664.</p></div>

The authority cited in the article on Claudius Flemmus is
"in Parnasso Euganeo," which a modern reader will probably find
difficult to identify immediately. Labbé is referring to Jacobus Philippus
Tomasinus (Jacopo Filippo Tomasini, 1597-1654), <i>Parnassus
Euganeus sive de scriptoribus ac literatis huius aevi claris</i> (Padua,
1647. 28 leaves). In the article on Tomasinus Labbé damns the
<i>Parnassus</i> wholeheartedly: "In fact, this book is so full of errors
[I use the modern bibliographer's cliché] that one scarcely finds
three or four articles correct and complete. (Verum hic liber mendosissimus
est, ut vix tria quatuorve nomina sincera atque integra
reperias)." This <i>Parnassus</i>, which is the only one that Labbé knew
or, at least, chose to cite, is different from Tomasini's <i>Parnassus
Euganeus sive museum clarissimorum virorum et antiquorum monumentorum
simulacris exornatum</i> (Padua, 1647. 10 leaves). The
first is a collection of biobibliographies, and the second is an account
of the portraits on the walls of Tomasini's villa. For comment on
these works see Christian Bruun's essay on Tomasini's friend, Johan
Rode, in <i>Paa Hundrede-aarsdagen efter at det store kongelige bibliothek
blev erklaeret for at vaere et offentligt bibliothek</i> (Copenhagen,
1893), p. 45.</p></div>

This remark shows that Meibom did not understand the
subject indexes. Meibom's review does not display any clear understanding
of what Labbé had written. It is perhaps pertinent to say
that Vogler's book is not a bibliography of bibliographies, although
Theodore Besterman includes it in <i>A World Bibliography of Bibliographies</i>,
2d ed., I, 322. There are copies of the 1670 edition in
ICN, NN, and my own library. This passage is quoted from the
edition published at Helmstadt in 1691, of which there is an enlargement
from a microfilm in my library; see pp. 160-161.</p></div>

Meibom is correct in his objection, but (it seems to me)
somewhat captious. The title of the book is deceptive and if Labbé
had cited it in full, he would have given his reader some useful
information and would have made clear that the book belonged
to a class that his contemporaries often regarded as closely akin
to bibliographies. The title is: <i>Bibliotheca, seu cynosura peregrinantium,
hoc est, Viatorium ... in duas partes digestum: quarum
prior ... complectitur I. Centuriam cum decuria problematum
apodemicorum. II. Multiplicia peregrinationis praecepta. III. Methodum
rerum explorandum. IV. Indicem viarum, etc. Posterior pars
exhibet I. Geographiam apodemicam. II. Historiographicam apodemicam.
III. Diarium apod[emicum] perpetuum, etc. IV. Precationes
et hymnos apodemicas</i> (Ulm, 1643-1644. MH [Prior Pars only]).
The book is curious and little-known.</p></div>

of this book in the University of Chicago Library (in part, at least,

wretched <i>Bibliographia</i> shakes one's faith in his critical judgment.
The <i>Bibliographia</i>, an unauthorized edition of J. H. Boecler's orientation
lectures at Strassburg, was first printed in 1677 and reprinted
in 1696. It deserved neither publication nor reprinting. In 1715
J. G. Krause added new materials from Boecler's lecture notes and
improved the quality of the critical remarks without remedying the
bibliographical defects. This new edition was entitled <i>Bibliographica
critica</i> (Leipzig, 1715). There are copies of the 1677 and 1715
editions in the Newberry Library and in my own library.</p></div>

The noun "bibliotheca" is to be understood here and in conjunction
with the following proper adjectives in his list. By Bibliotheca
Augustana Labbé meant the library at Augsburg. At the

to them by this short title made up for the purpose.</p></div>

See ed. 1704, pp. 294-298. <i>Die neu-eröffnete Bibliothec</i> has
a title of a sort that was popular at this time. The earliest parallel
that I have noted is J. U. M., <i>Neu-eröffnete Schaz-Kammer verschiedener
Natur- und Kunst-Wunder</i> (Nuremberg, 1689). See also
P. I. M. [Paul Jacob Marperger], <i>Die neu-eröffnete Kauffmanns-Börse</i>
(Hamburg, 1704) and I. M. P. a W., <i>Die neu-eröffnete Berg-Werck</i>
(Hamburg, 1704). The latest example that I have found
is the anonymous <i>Neu-eröffnete Vorraths-Kammer allerhand rarer
und nützlicher Kunst-Stücke</i> (Frankfurt a.M., 1760). <i>Die neu-eröffnete
Bibliothec</i> is obviously a piracy containing an unnamed
professor's lectures on the history of scholarship.</p></div>

and Professor Heinrich Schneider for these references. The
date 1650 is probably wrong. The foregoing authorities give the
date 1660. The <i>Catalogi Bibliothecae Thottianae</i>, VI (Copenhagen,

is strangely lacking in the first book to which one turns:
Hermann Conring, <i>De Bibliotheca Augusta</i> (Helmstadt, 1661;
"editio nova," 1684), which is reprinted in J. A. Schmid and J. J.
Mader, <i>De bibliothecis atque archivis</i> (Helmstadt, 1702-1705). In
this famous letter Conring discusses a proposal to make a catalogue
of the books at Wolfenbüttel and reaches the conclusion that it
cannot be executed. His neglect of his predecessor is curious.</p></div>

information. Dr. Arnold Weinberger tells me that Bartholomäus
Moser (d. 1678), "fürstlich augsburgischer Rat und Leibmedikus,"
wrote a biography of Francis Bacon (1645) and made a gift to the
University of Dillingen in 1676. See Thomas Specht, <i>Geschichte
der ehemaligen Universität Dillingen</i> (Freiburg i.B., 1902), I, 405.</p></div>

I have been unable to see any books by this author and have
been unable to collect much information about them or the author.
Groeningius announced a <i>Polyhistor bibliothecarius</i> in 1700, which
was to deal with law after the fashion of Morhof's "Polyhistor." He
planned the <i>Fasti rei litterariae</i> as a continuation of Morhof and
published it in 1702 under the title of <i>Relationes rei publicae litterariae</i>,
but this was only a sample of what he had in his mind. See
J. F. Jugler (ed.), B. G. Struve, <i>Bibliotheca historiae litterariae selecta</i>
(Jena, 1754-1763), pp. 52-54. Petzholdt cites (p. 658) legal
bibliographies by Groeningius and a <i>Bibliotheca universalis</i>, of which
they formed a part.</p></div>

The book is in two parts. The list of dictionaries in the second
part will not be discussed here, but see a contemporary parallel
cited by Léon Vallée (p. 268, No. 3145: Joh. Heumann) and earlier
bibliographers of dictionaries as cited by Teissier. The preface (pp.
1-66) to the <i>Dissertation sur les bibliothèques</i> is an account of ancient
and modern libraries. I do not recommend it.

An excellent survey of theological reference works in the preface
to J. G. Walch, <i>Bibliotheca theologica selecta</i> (Jena, 1757-1765) is

many such books, but is not a list of them.</p></div>

A few examples will suffice. Bucardi (i.e., Burkhardi) Gotthelffi
Struvii appears under the letter "B" (p. 81) and later ("Philosophique,"
p. 137) loses his family name. In the entry "Belgique"
(p. 75) the third item is credited to "id." which refers back to
Valerius Andreas, but the book meant is by J. F. Foppens, whose
name does not appear at all. A line or more has dropped out at
the bottom of p. 83. The dates of publication are unreliable: Borellus,
1754 should be 1654 (p. 78); Justinianus, 1712 should be 1612
(p. 117); and Lambecius, 1610 should be 1710 (p. 118). Labbé's
<i>Bibliotheca bibliothecarum</i> was printed in 1664, not 1674 (p. 118).</p></div>

He probably consulted the many treatises on what was then
called <i>historia litteraria</i>, but these were historical accounts of the
development of the various disciplines rather than bibliographies.
Two brief guides to these great specialized bibliographies are well
hidden. They are Benjamin Hederich, <i>Notitia auctorum antiqua &amp;
media, oder Leben, Schrifften, Editiones und Censuren der Biblischen
und entweder noch gantz oder auch nur in considerablen
Fragmentis vorhandenen fürnehmsten Griechischen und Lateinischen
Kirchen-Scholastischen- und Profan-Scribenten</i> (Wittenberg, 1714),
"Einleitung," pp. 2-144 and G. C. Hamberger, <i>Zuverlässige Nachrichten
von den vornehmsten Schriftstellern vom Anfange der Welt
bis 1500</i> (4 v.; Lemgo, 1756-1764), I, 1-54, "Erste vorläufige Abhandlung.
Von der Kentnis der Schriftsteller." These very interesting
and instructive compilations are selective guides to the best bibliographies
and are intended to aid students. They are limited almost
exclusively to bibliographies of classical Greek and Latin literature,
church history, and the related disciplines. Since the books in which
they appear deal only with authors and subjects belonging to the
period before 1500 and the bibliographies are similarly limited in
scope, the usefulness of the bibliographies is obviously confined to
giving information about the best current reference works in a few
fields. No doubt the abundant bibliographical information in such
a work as Heinrich Zedler, <i>Grosses vollständiges Universal Lexikon
aller Wissenschaften und Künste</i> (68 v.; Halle, 1732-1754) was
sufficient for most scholarly needs.</p></div>

I do not see what principle guides him in the choice of
bibliographies published in the editions of an author's works. He
does not include, for example, a very curious bibliography in Marcus
Meibomius (ed.), Diogenes Laertius, <i>De vitis, dogmatibus et apophthegmatibus
clarorum philosophorum</i> (Amsterdam, 1692). It is the
first bibliography, as far as I know, to give systematically the locations
of the books cited. The first example of a reference to the
place where a book may be found is, I believe, in Giovanni Nevizzano
(Johannes Nevizzanus), <i>Quaestiones</i> (ed. L. Gómez; Venice,
1525). I quote it from Wilhelm Fuchs, "Die Anfänge juristischer
Fachbibliographie," <i>Archiv für Bibliographie, Buch- und Bibliothekswesen</i>,

I am of course aware that the <i>Guide to Reference Books</i>
originally written by Alice Kroeger has passed through many editions
and has had two subsequent editors. Its well-deserved success
is no very strong argument for the usefulness of a classified arrangement.
The <i>Guide</i> is, it must be recognized, a very special sort of
reference work. It has been intended from the beginning to serve
reference librarians and has been improved and enlarged for that
use. In other words, it has always had very limited and highly
trained readers familiar with its special methods. The latest edition
is by Constance M. Winchell (7th ed.; Chicago, 1951).</p></div>

See p. 712. This pamphlet (ICN) is an anonymous catalogue
of the library of Tommaso Giuseppe Farsetti. G. A. E. Bogeng
calls it a model piece of work; see <i>Jahrbuch für Bücherkunde und
Liebhaberei</i>, II (1910), 44. In his treatise <i>Die grossen Bibliophilen.
Geschichte der Büchersammler und ihre Sammlungen</i> (Leipzig,
1922), III, 30, Bogeng names Giacomo or Jacopo Morelli (1745-1819)
as the author. Gustave Brunet, who has seen the <i>Catalogo</i>,
says: "Ce petit volume de 207 pages offre l'inventaire raisonnée
d'une collection fort importante de rarétés dramatiques appartenant
au bailli Farsetti. De notes nombreuses et parfois d'une certain
étendue lui donnent du prix" (<i>Dictionnaire de bibliographie catholique</i>
[Paris, 1860], col. 631). Curiously enough, Frati's account of
Italian book-collectors, bibliographers, and librarians does not include
Farsetti and makes no mention of this and other catalogues
of the Farsetti library in the article on Jacopo Morelli; see <i>Dizionario
biobibliografico dei bibliotecari e bibliofili italiani dal sec.

I mention here Winslow L. Webber (b. 1898), <i>Books about
Books</i> (Boston, 1937), primarily because of its title. This annotated
list of books and articles useful to collectors of incunabula, English
and American first editions and rarities, and Americana does not
intend to be a general bibliography of bibliographies. Webber's
comments are occasionally instructive or entertaining, but his references
are distressingly careless. "Pretsholdt's" (p. 19) for "Petzholdt's"
speaks for itself. The chapter "Magazine References" (pp.
136-162), which contains a survey of articles published in British
and American journals between 1900 and 1937, is perhaps the most
useful part of the book.</p></div>

For example, "J. B. Childs, Sixteenth-century books. Chicago,

that it appeared in the <i>Papers of the Bibliographical Society of

nazionali</i> is a reprint from a journal and has been replaced by <i>Le
bibliografie nazionali</i> (Milan, 1935), which is now in turn replaced
by a second edition. The books by Alice B. Kroeger and Isadore

Bibliographies of bibliographies found in handbooks of library
science and bibliographies of reference works (which may often be
bibliographies) have not been included in this essay. There are
good books of these kinds that might seem to have been overlooked.
For example, Georg Schneider, <i>Handbuch der Bibliographie</i> (4th
ed.; Leipzig, 1930) names only currently useful lists of books and
no bibliographies of subjects. His account of the bibliographies of
incunabula (pp. 85-103) is an excellent introduction to a difficult
subject, but gives no idea of the historical development of these
works and cites the earliest bibliographies (p. 92, n. 1) in such a
way that only an expert can interpret the references. A good American
parallel to Schneider's book is H. B. van Hoesen and F. K.
Walter, <i>Bibliography, practical, enumerative, historical: an introductory
manual</i> (New York, 1928); a new edition is in preparation.
John Minto, <i>Reference Books</i> (2 v.; London, 1929-1931) and Constance
M. Winchell, <i>Guide to Reference Books</i> (7th ed.; Chicago,
1951) are guides to reference books, not bibliographies of bibliographies,
Frantz Calot and Georges Thomas, <i>Guide practique de
bibliographie</i> (Paris, 1936; 2d ed., Paris, 1950) is often a helpful
guide to information, but it is not a bibliography of bibliographies.</p></div>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
